The rare isolated photons tend to originate directly in hard QCD scattering, in contrast to copiously produced non-isolated photons that arise from nonperturbative processes such as am and 7 decays, or from via quasi-collinear radiation off final-state quarks and gluons. We evaluate contributions to continuum diphoton production from the basic short- distance channels for yy production initiated by quark-antiquark and (anti)quark-gluon scattering, as well as by gluon-gluon and gluon-(anti)quark scattering proceeding through a fermion-loop diagram. At lowest order in QCD, a photon pair is produced from q@ anni- hilation [Fig. [I] (a)]. Representative next-to-leading order (NLO) contributions to qq@ + gg scattering are shown in Fig.[I](b)-(e). They are of O(a,) in the strong coupling strength id 5 Production of 77 pairs via a box diagram in gg scattering [Fig. [1] (h)] is suppressed by two powers of a, compared to the lowest-order g@ contribution, but it is enhanced by a product of two large gluon parton distribution functions (PDFs) if typical momentum fractions x are small [6]. The O(a?) or NLO corrections to gg scattering include one-loop gg + yyg diagrams (i) and (j) derived in Ref. (7, ig}. as well as 4-leg two-loop diagrams (1) computed in Ref. ata In this study we also include subleading contributions from the process (k), 94s > Yy4s via the quark loop, where gg = >> combination of quark scattering channels. (qi + G) denotes the flavor-singlet i=u,d,s,... Factorization is a central principle of hadronic calculations in perturbative QCD, in which a high-energy scattering cross section is expressed as a convolution of a perturbative partonic cross section with nonperturbative parton distribution functions (PDFs), thus separating short-distance from long-distance physics. The common factorization is a longitudinal no- tion, in the sense that the convolution is an integral over longitudinal momentum fractions, even if some partons in the hard-scattering process have transverse momenta that border the nonperturbative regime. Unphysical features may then arise in the transverse momentum (Qr) distribution of a color-neutral object with high invariant mass (Q), such as a pair of photons produced in hadron-hadron collisions. When calculated in the common factorization approach at any finite order in perturbation theory, this distribution diverges as Qr \u2014 0, signaling that infrared singularities associated with Q; \u2014 0 have not been properly iso- lated and regulated. These singularities are associated with soft and collinear radiation from initial-state partons shown by the diagrams in Figs. [I] (b), (d), and (i). A generalized factorization approach that correctly describes the small-Qr region was developed by Collins, Soper, and Sterman (CSS) and applied to photon pair produc- tion rie . In this approach the hadronic cross section is expressed as an integral over the transverse coordinate (impact parameter). The integrable singular functions present in the finite-order differential distribution as Qr \u2014 0 are resummed, to all orders in the strong coupling a,, into a Sudakov exponent, and a well-behaved cross section is obtained for all Qr values. As explained in Sec. II, our resummed calculation is accurate to next-to- next-to-leading-logarithmic (NNLL) order. It is applicable for values of diphoton transverse momentum that are less than the diphoton mass, i.e., for Qr < Q. When Qr ~ Q, terms of the form In\"(Q7r/Q) become small. A perturbative expansion with a single hard scale is then applicable, and the cross section can be obtained from finite-order perturbation theory. In addition to the initial-state logarithmic singularities, there is a set of important final- state singularities which arise in the matrix elements when at least one photon\u2019s momentum is collinear to the momentum of a final-state parton. They are sometimes referred to as \u2018fragmentation\u2019 singularities. At lowest order in az, the final-state singularity appears only in the gg > yyq diagrams, as in Fig. [I] (e). There are various methods used in the literature to deal with the final-state singularity, including the introduction of explicit fragmentation functions D,(z) for hard photon production, where z is the light-cone fraction of the interme- diate parton\u2019s momentum carried by the photon. These single-photon \u201cone-fragmentation\u201d and \u201ctwo-fragmentation\u201d contributions, corresponding to one or both photons produced in independent fragmentation processes, are illustrated by the diagrams in Figs. [I] (f) and (g). In addition, a fragmentation contribution of entirely different nature arises when the yy pair is relatively light and produced from fragmentation of one parton, as discussed in Secs. [IC 2] and{M1A 3} A full and consistent treatment of the final-state logarithms beyond lowest order would require a joint resummation of the initial- and final-state logarithmic singularities. . In the work reported here, we are guided by our interest in describing the cross section for isolated photons, in which the fragmentation contributions are largely suppressed. A typical isolation condition requires the hadronic activity to be minimal (e.g., comparable to the underlying event) in the immediate neighborhood of each candidate photon. Candidate photons can be rejected by energy deposit nearby in the hadronic calorimeter or the presence of hadronic tracks near the photons. A theory calculation may approximate the experimental isolation by requiring the full energy of the hadronic remnants to be less than a threshold \u201cisolation energy\u201d ES? in a cone of size AR around each photon. The two photons must be also separated in the plane of the rapidity 7 and azimuthal angle y by an amount exceeding the resolution AR,, of the detector. The values of E?, AR, and AR,, serve as crude characteristics of the actual measurement. The magnitude of the final-state fragmentation contribution depends on the assumed values of \u00a37\u00b0, AR, and AR,,. An additional ompliation arises when the fragmentation radiation is assumed to be tions D\u03b3(z). The ollinear approximation onstrains from below the values of z aessible to D\u03b3(z): z > zmin. The size of the fragmentation ontribution may depend strongly on the values of Eiso T and zmin as a onsequene of rapid variation of D\u03b3(z) with z. In our work we treat the final-state singularity using a prescription that reproduces desir- able features of the isolated cross sections while bypassing some of the technical difficulties alluded to above. For Qr > E%S?, we avoid the final-state collinear singularity in the qg scattering channel by applying quasi-experimental isolation. When Qr < E%$\u00b0, we apply an auxiliary regulator which approximates on average the full NLO rate from direct qg and fragmentation cross sections in this Qr range. Two prescriptions for the auxiliary regulator (subtraction and smooth-cone isolation inside the photon\u2019s isolation cone) are considered and lead to"}, "embedding": {"embedding_model":
