All next-to-leading order perturbative contributions from quark-antiquark, gluon-(anti)quark, and gluon-gluon subprocesses are included, as well as all-orders resummation of initial-state gluon radiation valid at next-to-next-to- eading logarithmic accuracy. The region of phase space is specified in which the calculation is most reliable. Good agreement is demonstrated with data from the Fermilab Tevatron, and predictions are made for more detailed tests with CDF and D@ data. Predictions are shown for distributions of di pairs produced at the energy of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).

This resummation is essential for physially meaningful preditions of the transverse momentum (QT ) distri- bution of the diphotons at small and intermediate values of QT , where the ross setion is Our attention is focused on the production of isolated photons, 7.e., high-energy photons observed at some distance from appreciable hadronic remnants in the particle detector. The rare isolated photons tend to originate directly in hard QCD scattering, in contrast to copiously produced non-isolated photons that arise from nonperturbative processes such as am and 7 decays, or from via quasi-collinear radiation off final-state quarks and gluons. We evaluate contributions to continuum diphoton production from the basic short- distance channels for yy production initiated by quark-antiquark and (anti)quark-gluon scattering, as well as by gluon-gluon and gluon-(anti)quark scattering proceeding through a fermion-loop diagram. At lowest order in QCD, a photon pair is produced from q@ anni- hilation [Fig. [I] (a)]. Representative next-to-leading order (NLO) contributions to qq@ + gg scattering are shown in Fig.[I](b)-(e). They are of O(a,) in the strong coupling strength id 5 Production of 77 pairs via a box diagram in gg scattering [Fig. [1] (h)] is suppressed by two powers of a, compared to the lowest-order g@ contribution, but it is enhanced by a product of two large gluon parton distribution functions (PDFs) if typical momentum fractions x are small [6]. The O(a?) or NLO corrections to gg scattering include one-loop gg + yyg diagrams (i) and (j) derived in Ref. (7, ig}. as well as 4-leg two-loop diagrams (1) computed in Ref. ata In this study we also include subleading contributions from the process (k), 94s > Yy4s via the quark loop, where gg = >> combination of quark scattering channels. (qi + G) denotes the flavor-singlet i=u,d,s,... Factorization is a central principle of hadronic calculations in perturbative QCD, in which a high-energy scattering cross section is expressed as a convolution of a perturbative partonic cross section with nonperturbative parton distribution functions (PDFs), thus separating short-distance from long-distance physics. The common factorization is a longitudinal no- tion, in the sense that the convolution is an integral over longitudinal momentum fractions, even if some partons in the hard-scattering process have transverse momenta that border the nonperturbative regime. Unphysical features may then arise in the transverse momentum (Qr) distribution of a color-neutral object with high invariant mass (Q), such as a pair of photons produced in hadron-hadron collisions. When calculated in the common factorization approach at any finite order in perturbation theory, this distribution diverges as Qr — 0, signaling that infrared singularities associated with Q; — 0 have not been properly iso- lated and regulated. These singularities are associated with soft and collinear radiation from initial-state partons shown by the diagrams in Figs. [I] (b), (d), and (i). A generalized factorization approach that correctly describes the small-Qr region was developed by Collins, Soper, and Sterman (CSS) and applied to photon pair produc- tion rie . In this approach the hadronic cross section is expressed as an integral over the transverse coordinate (impact parameter). The integrable singular functions present in the finite-order differential distribution as Qr — 0 are resummed, to all orders in the strong coupling a,, into a Sudakov exponent, and a well-behaved cross section is obtained for all Qr values. As explained in Sec. II, our resummed calculation is accurate to next-to- next-to-leading-logarithmic (NNLL) order. It is applicable for values of diphoton transverse momentum that are less than the diphoton mass, i.e., for Qr < Q. When Qr ~ Q, terms of the form In'(Q7r/Q) become small. A perturbative expansion with a single hard scale is then applicable, and the cross section can be obtained from finite-order perturbation theory. In addition to the initial-state logarithmic singularities, there is a set of important final- state singularities which arise in the matrix elements when at least one photon’s momentum is collinear to the momentum of a final-state parton. They are sometimes referred to as ‘fragmentation’ singularities. At lowest order in az, the final-state singularity appears only in the gg > yyq diagrams, as in Fig. [I] (e). There are various methods used in the literature to deal with the final-state singularity, including the introduction of explicit fragmentation functions D,(z) for hard photon production, where z is the light-cone fraction of the interme- diate parton’s momentum carried by the photon. These single-photon “one-fragmentation” and “two-fragmentation” contributions, corresponding to one or both photons produced in independent fragmentation processes, are illustrated by the diagrams in Figs. [I] (f) and (g). In addition, a fragmentation contribution of entirely different nature arises when the yy pair is relatively light and produced from fragmentation of one parton, as discussed in Secs. [IC 2] and{M1A 3} A full and consistent treatment of the final-state logarithms beyond lowest order would require a joint resummation of the initial- and final-state logarithmic singularities. . In the work reported here, we are guided by our interest in describing the cross section for isolated photons, in which the fragmentation contributions are largely suppressed. A typical isolation condition requires the hadronic activity to be minimal (e.g., comparable to the underlying event) in the immediate neighborhood of each candidate photon. Candidate photons can be rejected by energy deposit nearby in the hadronic calorimeter or the presence of hadronic tracks near the photons. A theory calculation may approximate the experimental isolation by requiring the full energy of the hadronic remnants to be less than a threshold “isolation energy” ES? in a cone of size AR around each photon. The two photons must be also separated in the plane of the rapidity 7 and azimuthal angle y by an amount exceeding the resolution AR,, of the detector. The values of E?, AR, and AR,, serve as crude characteristics of the actual measurement. The magnitude of the final-state fragmentation contribution depends on the assumed values of £7°, AR, and AR,,. An additional ompliation arises when the fragmentation radiation is assumed to be tions Dγ(z). The ollinear approximation onstrains from below the values of z aessible to Dγ(z): z > zmin. The size of the fragmentation ontribution may depend strongly on the values of Eiso T and zmin as a onsequene of rapid variation of Dγ(z) with z. In our work we treat the final-state singularity using a prescription that reproduces desir- able features of the isolated cross sections while bypassing some of the technical difficulties alluded to above. For Qr > E%S?, we avoid the final-state collinear singularity in the qg scattering channel by applying quasi-experimental isolation. When Qr < E%$°, we apply an auxiliary regulator which approximates on average the full NLO rate from direct qg and fragmentation cross sections in this Qr range. Two prescriptions for the auxiliary regulator (subtraction and smooth-cone isolation inside the photon’s isolation cone) are considered and lead to similar predictions at the Tevatron and the LHC. data. Resummation is shown to be important for the successful description of physical Qr distributions, as well as for stable estimates of the effects of experimental acceptance on distributions in the diphoton invariant mass. We compare our results with the DIPHOX calculation (14) and demonstrate that the requirement Qr < Q further suppresses the effects of the final-state fragmentation contribution, beyond the reduction associated with isolation. Next, we present our predictions for distributions of diphoton pairs produced at the energy of the LHC. Various distributions of the diphoton pairs produced from the decay of a Higgs boson are contrasted with those produced from QCD continuum processes at the LHC, showing that enhanced sensitivity to the signal can be obtained with judicious event selection. Our conclusions are presented in Sec.

The Collins- Soper frame is a rest frame of the γγ pair (with qµ = Q,0,0,0 { } in this frame), hosen ~P1 and ~P2 of the initial hadrons lie in the Oxz plane (with zero so that (a) the momenta azimuthal angle), and (b) the z axis bisets the angle between ~P1 and − ~P2.

In this section, we derive resummed predictions for the fully differential yy cross section do/(dQ?dydQ7.dQ..), where dQ, = dcos6@,dy, is a solid angle element around the direction of Py in the Collins-Soper frame defined in Eq. (). The angles in the Collins-Soper frame are denoted by a “x” subscript, in contrast to angles in the lab frame, which do not have such a subscript.

These “initial-state” logarithmic contributions are summed to all orders later in this subsection. The NLO qg cross section also contains a large logarithm when one of the photons is pro- duced from a collinear ‘q’ 3 Vy splitting in the final state. This “final-state” collinear limit is discussed in Section [ILC] in the gg+gqgs scattering channel. The functions F.,5(Q, y, 0.) and FO.

The q¯q + qg asymptoti ross setion Aq¯q(Q,QT,y,Ω∗) is proportional to the angular funtion Σi(θ∗), the same as in the Born q¯q γγ ross setion, f. Eq. (7). Similarly, the → gg+gqS asymptoti ross setion Agg(Q,QT,y,Ω∗) inludes a term proportional to the Born angular funtion Σg(θ∗). In addition, Agg(Q,QT,y,Ω∗) ontains another term proportional to Σ′ g(θ∗,ϕ∗) ≡ L′ g(θ∗)cos2ϕ∗, where L′ g(θ∗) is derived in Ref. [3℄. This term arises due to the the azimuthal angle (ϕ∗) distribution of the photons in the Collins-Soper frame [3℄. The small-Qr representations in Eqs. and can be used to compute fixed-order article distributions in the phase-space slicing method. In this method, we choose a small Qr value Q;” in the range of validity of Eqs. and (14). If the actual Qr in the computation exceeds Q7”, we calculate the differential cross section using the full 2 > 3 matrix element. When Qr is smaller than Q7”, we calculate the event rate using the small- Qr asymptotic approximation A(Q, Qr, y, 2.) and 2 — 2 phase space. Hence, the lowest bin of the Qr distribution is approximated in the NLO prediction by its average value in the interval 0 < Qr < Q7?, computed by integration of the asymptotic approximations. The phase-space slicing procedure is sufficient for predictions of observables inclusive in Qr, but not of the shape of do/dQr distributions. The latter goal is met by all-orders summa- tion of singular asymptotic contributions with the help of the Collins-Soper-Sterman (CSS) metho {it [16, . The small-Qr resummed cross section is denoted as W(Q, Qr, y, Qs) and given by a two-dimensional Fourier transform of a function W(Q, b, y, 2.) that depends on the impact parameter b: The “hard-vertex” function ¥, (0. )hZ(Q, 6.) is the normalized cross section for the Born scat- tering aa > yy, with a = u,u,d,d,... in qq yy, and a=a=gq in gg > yy.

In this model, the perturbative orm factor Wpert(Q, be, y, Q«) in Eq. is evaluated as a function of b, = b/(1+0?/b?,,,)/, with Dinar = 1.5 GeV!. The factorization scale ju in [C @ f] is set equal to co/b-2 + Q?,, , where Qjnj is the initial scale of order 1 GeV in the parameterization employed for fosn(a, [4), or instance, 1.3 GeV for the CTEQ6 PDFs [19]. We have Wyerr(be) = Wpere(d) at b? < b2,,,, and Woere(b = Woert(Pmax) at b? >> b? ‘max * Hence this ansatz preserves the exact form of the erturbative form factor Wrert(Q, b, y, Qe) in the perturbative region of small b, while also incorporating the leading nonperturbative contributions (described by a phenomenological unction Fy p(Q, b)) at large b. The form of Fy p(Q,b) found in the global pr fit in Ref. (13) suggests approximate inde- endence of Fy p(Q, b) from the type of gg scattering process. It is used here to describe the nonperturbative terms in the leading gq + yy channel. We neglect possible corrections to he nonperturbative contributions arising from the final-state soft radiation in the qq chan- nel and additional VS dependence affecting Drell-Yan-like processes at 2 < 107? , as hese exceed the accuracy of the present measurements at the Tevatron. The experimentally unknown Fyp(Q,b) in the gg channel is approximated by Fyp(Q,b) for the gq channel, multiplied by the ratio CA/CF = 9/4. This hoie is motivated by the fat that the lead- (k) in the gg and q¯q hannels are proportional to CA = 3 and a ing Sudakov olor fators A CF = 4/3, respetively. The unertainties in the γγ ross setions assoiated with FNP(Q,b) In the region Qr ~ Q, collinear QCD factorization at a finite fixed order in a, is ap- plicable. In order to include non-singular contributions important in this region, we add to W(Q, Qr, y, Q.) the regular piece Y (Q, Qr, y, Q.), defined as the difference between the NLO cross section P(Q, Qr,y,Q.) and its small-Qr asymptotic approximation A(Q, Qr, y, Q.): At small Qr, subtraction of A(Q, Qr,y,Q.) in Eq. (£9) cancels large initial-state radia- tive corrections in P(Q,Qr,y,Q.), which are incorporated in their resummed form within W(Q, Qr,y,Q2.). At Qr comparable to Q, A(Q,Qr,y,Q.) cancels the leading terms in W(Q, Qr,y,Q.), but higher-order contributions remain from the infinite tower of logarith- mic terms that are resummed in W. In this situation the W + Y cross section drops below the finite-order result P(Q, Qr, y,Q.) at some value of Qr (referred to as the crossing point) in both the gq+qg and gg+ gqs channels, for each Q and y. We use the W + Y cross section as our final prediction at Qr values below the crossing point, and the NLO cross section P at Qr values above the crossing point. A few comments are in order about our resummation calculation. The hard-vertex contri- bution U,(,)h2(Q, 6.) and the functions B, (C1, Co, ft) and Ca/a, (x, b; C/C2, ju) can be varied in a mutually compensating way while preserving the same value of the form factor W up to higher-order corrections in a,. This ambiguity, or dependence on the chosen “resummation scheme” within the CSS formalism, can be employed to explore the sensitivity of the- oretical predictions to further next-to-next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic (NNNLL) effects that are not accounted for explicitly. The perturbative coefficients in Appendix[Alare presented in the CSS resummation scheme (ul), our default choice in numerical calculations, and in an alternative scheme by Catani, de Florian and Grazzini (CFG) j2il]. In the original CSS resummation scheme, the B and C functions contain the finite virtual NLO corrections to the 2 — 2 scattering process, whereas in the CFG scheme the universal 6 and C depend only on the type of incident artons, and the process-dependent virtual correction is included in the function h,. The difference between the CSS and CFG schemes is numerically small in yy production at both he Tevatron and the LHC i3). In the gg + gqs scattering channel, the unpolarized resummed cross section includes an additional contribution from_elements of ky-dependent PDF spin matrices with opposite helicities of outgoing gluons [3]. The NLO expansion of this spin-flip resummed cross section generates the term proportional to Ly (Oe; Px) x cos 2y, in the small-Qr asymptotic cross section, cf. Eq. (14). Although the logarithmic spin-flip contribution must be resummed in rinciple to all orders to predict the y, dependence in the gg + gqg channel, it is neglected in the present work in view of its small effect on the full yy cross section. When integrated over QT from 0 to sales of order Q, the resummed ross setion be- a few-perent orretion from integrated higher-order terms logarithmi in QT . observables that allow such integration (e.g., the large-Q region of the yy invariant mass distribution) are approximated well both by the resummed and NLO calculations. How- ever, the experimental acceptance constrains the range of the integration over Qr in parts of phase space and may break delicate cancellations between integrable singularities present in the finite-order differential distribution. In this situation (e.g., in the vicinity of the kine- matic cutoff in do/dQ discussed in Sec. the NLO cross section becomes unstable, while the resummed cross section (free of discontinuities) continues to depend smoothly on kine- matic constraints. We see that the resummation is essential not only for the prediction of physical Qr distributions in yy production, but also for credible estimates of the effects of experimental acceptance on distributions in the diphoton invariant mass and other variables. In addition to the QCD singularities associated with initial-state radiation [described by the asymptotic terms in Eqs. and (14)], other singularities arise in the O(a,) process q(p1) + 9(p2) > y(p3) + (ps) + 9(ps) [Fig. Hl (e)| when a photon is collinear to the final-state quark. In this limit, the gg + qyy squared matrix element grows as 1/s,5, when s,; — 0, where 5,5, is the squared invariant mass of the collinear yq pair. In this limit, the squared matrix element factors as into the product of the squared matrix element |M(qg > a) for the production of a photon and an intermediate quark, and a splitting function P),(z) = (1+ (1 — 2)?)/z for fragmentation of the intermediate quark into a collinear yq pair. In Eq. (20) z is the light- cone fraction of the intermediate quark’s momentum carried by the fragmentation photon, and ee; is the charge of the intermediate quark. When the photon-quark separation Ar = V(n5 — my)? + (es — 5)? in the plane of pseudorapidity 7 = —log(tan(@/2)) and azimuthal angle y in the lab frame is small, as in the collinear limit, sj; ~ Ep, ErsAr?, where Ey, and Fr; are the transverse energies of the photon and quark, with Ey = Esin@. Note that Ets = Qr at the order in a, at which we are working. Therefore, contributions from the final-state collinear, or fragmentation, region are most pronounced at small Ar and relatively small Qr.! A fully consistent treatment of the initial- and final-state singularities would require a joint initial- and final-state resummation. In the approaches taken to date, the fragmentation singularity may be subtracted from the direct cross section and replaced by a single-photon “one-fragmentation” contribution g +g — (q frag y) +7, where “(q frag 7)” denotes collinear production of one hard photon from a quark, described by a function D,(z, (1) at a light- cone momentum fraction z and factorization scale ju. Single-photon “two-fragmentation” γ) + (¯q ontributions arise in proesses like g + g γ) and involve onvolutions (q −→ → −→ with two funtions Dγ(z,µ) (one per photon). The lowest-order Feynman diagrams for the Parameterizations must be adopted for the nonperturbative funtions Dγ(z,µ) at an initial sale µ = µ0. This is the approah followed in the DIPHOX alulation [14℄, in whih the sum of real and virtual NLO orretions to diret and single-γ fragmentation ross setions rate is inreased by higher-order ontributions from photon prodution within hadroni jets. An infrared-safe procedure can be formulated to apply isolation cuts at each order of As (22, 23, [a4}. This procedure encounters difficulties in reproducing the effects of isolation on fragmentation contributions, because theoretical models reflect only basic features of the experimental isolation and may introduce new logarithmic singularities near the edges of the isolation cones. As mentioned in the Introduction, the magnitude of the fragmentation contribution de- ends on the values of isolation parameters E?°, AR, and AR,,, modeled only approximately in a theoretical calculation. The collinear approximation constrains from below the values of z accessible to Dy(z, 1): 2 > Zmin = (1+ Ef8/Er,)~'. If D,(z, u) varies rapidly with z, he fragmentation cross section is particularly sensitive to the assumed values of E7°° and Zmin- For instance, if D(z, ) ~ 1/z, the fragmentation cross section is roughly proportional o Ey? under a typical condition Ej°/Ey, < 1. Such nearly linear dependence on Ef? of he fragmentation cross section da/dQr is indeed observed in the DIPHOX calculation, as reviewed in Sec. In reality, some spread of the parton radiation in the direction trans- verse to the photon’s motion is expected. The treatment of kinematics in parton showering rograms like PYTHIA results in somewhat different dependence on z (12 compared to the collinear approximation, hence in a different magnitude of the fragmentation cross section. In this work we adopt a procedure that reproduces desirable features of the isolated cross sections, while bypassing some of the difficulties summarized above. To simulate experimen- al isolation, we reject an event if (a) the separation Ar between the final-state parton and one of the photons is less than AR, and (b) Eps of the parton is larger than E}°. This condition is applied to the NLO cross section P(Q, Qr, y, Qs), but not to W(Q, Qr, y, Q«) and A(Q, Qr,y, 9), as these correspond to initial-state QCD radiation and are free of the final-state collinear singularity. This quasi-experimental isolation excludes the singular final-state direct contributions at Eps > Eis? and Ar < AR (or S45 < Ep, Er; AR’). It is effective for Qr > Ex, but he collinear direct contributions survive when Qr < E‘S°. The integrated (but not the differential) fragmentation rate in the region Q; < Eis? may be estimated from a calculation with explicit fragmentation functions. In our approach, we do not introduce fragmentation unctions, but we apply an auxiliary regulator to the direct gg cross section at Qr < E%? and Ar < AR. In our numerical study we find that this prescription preserves a continuous differential distribution except for a small finite discontinuity at Qr = E/S°. It approximately reproduces the integrated qg rate obtained in the DIPHOX calculation at small Qr, for the nominal E%°. = the leading part Eq. (20) of the diret qg matrix element when ET5 < Eiso T and ∆r < ∆R. f, pµ p5), where pµ 5, and pµ pf +ps · ps · We take z = 1 p5/(ps · p5 +pf · s are the four-momenta − of the fragmentation photon, fragmentation quark, and spetator photon, respetively [26℄. This presription is used in most of the numerial results in this paper. In the second case, we suppress fragmentation contributions at Ar < AR and Eps < ES? by rejecting events in the AR cone that satisfy Ers < (Ar), where y(Ar)_is a smooth function satisfying y(0) = 0, y(AR) = E's’. This “smooth-cone isolation” transforms the fragmentation singularity associated with D,(z, 2) into an integrable singularity, which depends on the assumed functional form of x(Ar). The cross section for direct contributions is rendered finite by this prescription without explicit introduction of fragmentation functions D,(z, 1). For our smooth function, we choose y(Ar) = E%°(1—cos Ar)?/(1—cos AR)’, which differs from the specific form considered in Ref. 25], but still satisfies the condition y(0) = 0. Our earlier results in Ref. (2 are computed with this prescription. Here we employ it only in a few instances for comparison with the subtraction method and obtain similar results. Differences between the two prescriptions can be used to quantify sensitivity of the pre- dictions to the treatment of the Qr < E%? and Ar < AR region. The two prescriptions yield identical predictions outside of this restricted region, notably at Qr > ES, where our NLO perturbative expression P(Q, Qr, y,.) in the gg + gg channel is controlled only by quasi-experimental isolation and coincides with the corresponding direct cross section in DIPHOX. The default subtraction prescription predicts a vanishing do/dQr in the extreme Qr — 0 limit, while the smooth-cone prescription has an integrable singularity in this limit, avoided by an explicit small-Qr cutoff in the calculation of our Y-piece. Both prescriptions are free of the logarithmic singularity at Q; = E%$° arising in the fixed-order (DIPHOX) calculation. Another class of large radiative corrections arises when the yy invariant mass Q is smaller than the yy transverse momentum QT. In this case, one final-state quark or gluon fragments into a low-mass yy pair, e.g. as g+g > (q¢ frag yy) + g. The lowest-order contributions of this kind are shown in Fig. The process is described by a 7y-fragmentation func- tion D,,(21, 22,4), different from the single-photon fragmentation function D,(z, 4). This ulations, even though similar fragmentation mehanisms have been studied in large-QT Drell-Yan pair prodution [27, 28℄. The importane of low-Q γγ-fragmentation may be el- evated in some kinemati regions for typial experimental uts. They an be removed by We conclude this section by summarizing the main features of our calculation. Full direct NLO cross sections, represented by the graphs (a)-(e), (h)-(1) in Fig. H] are computed, and their initial-state soft/collinear logarithmic singularities are resummed at small Qr in both the qg+qg and gg+gqs channels. The perturbative Sudakov functions A and B and Wilson coefficient functions C in the resummed cross section W are computed up to orders a2, a2, and as, respectively, corresponding to resummation at NNLL accuracy. Our resummation calculation requires an integration over all values of impact parameter b, including the nonperturbative region of large b. In our default calculation_of the resummed cross section, we adopt the nonperturbative functions introduced in Ref. . We consider two resummation schemes, the traditional scheme introduced in the CSS paper as well as an alternative scheme . The comparison allows us to estimate the magnitude of yet higher- order corrections that are not included. The size of these effects is different in the gg + qg and gg + gqs channels but not particularly significant in either The final-state collinear singularity in the qg scattering channel i is avoided by applying quasi-experimental isolation when Q; > E%° and an auxiliary regulator when Qr < ES? to approximate on average the full NLO rate from direct gg and fragmentation cross sections in this Qr range. Two prescriptions for the auxiliary regulator (subtraction and smooth isolation inside the photon’s isolation cone) are considered and lead to similar predictions at the Tevatron and LHC. The singular logarithmic contributions associated with initial-state radiation are sub- tracted from the NLO cross section P to form a regular piece Y, which is added to the small-Qr resummed cross section W to predict the production rate for small and intermedi- ate values of Qr. In the gg + gqg channel, we also subtract from P a new singular spin-flip contribution that affects azimuthal angle (y,) dependence in the Collins-Soper reference frame. We switch our prediction to the fixed-order perturbative result P at the point in Qr where the cross section W+Y drops below P. This crossing point is located at Qr of order Q in both qq + qg and gg + gqs channels. Our calculation of the differential cross section da /(dQdQrdydQ..) is especially pertinent for the transverse momentum Qr distribution in the region Qr < Q, for fixed values of diphoton mass Q (cf. Section [TIA J). It would be best to compare our multiple differential distribution with experiment, but published collider data tend to be presented in the form of singly differential distributions in Q, Qr, and Ay = 3 — Yq in the lab frame, after integration over the other independent kinematic variables. We follow suit in order to make comparisons with Tevatron collider data, but we recommend that more differential studies be made, and we comment on the features that can be explored. We show results at the energy of the Tevatron collider and then make predictions for the Large Hadron Collider. The analytical results of Sec. [| are implemented in our computer code. As a first step, resummed and NLO 77 cross sections are computed on a grid of discrete values of Q, Qr, and y by using the resummation program LEGACY described in Refs. 29, 30}. At the second stage, matching of the resummed and NLO cross sections is performed, and fully differential cross sections are evaluated by Monte-Carlo integration of the matched grids in the latest version of the program RESBOS i311 (39). The calculation is done for Ny = 5 active quark flavors and the following values of the electroweak and strong interaction parameters [33 The following choices of the factorization constants are used: C, = C3 = 2e°78 & 1.123..., and Cy = Cy, = 1. The choice Cy = 1 implies that we equate the renormalization and factorization scales to the invariant mass of the photon pair, 4p = yr = Q, in the fixed- order and asymptotic contributions P(Q, Qr,y,Q.) and A(Q, Qr,y, 2.4). We use two-loop expressions for the running electromagnetic and strong couplings a(j:) and ag(j), as well as the NLO parton distribution function set CTEQ6M with Qing = 1.3 GeV. For calculations with explicit final-state fragmentation functions included, we use set 1 of the NLO photon fragmentation functions from Ref. . In this setion, we present our results for the Tevatron p¯p ollider operating at √S = 1.96 TeV.

Our theoretical framework is applicable in the region Qr < Q (large Ay), where the dominant fraction of events occurs. The appearance of singularities in the NLO calculation at Qr — 0 and the fact that there are two different hard scales, Qr and Q, relevant for the event distributions in the low-Qr region require that we address and resum large logarithmic terms of the form log(Q/Qr). Different and interesting physics becomes important in the complementary region Qr > Q (small Ay), a topic we address in Sec. We compare our resummed and finite-order predictions for the invariant mass (Q) dis- tribution of photon pairs, shown in Fig. A] as solid and dashed lines, respectively. The finite-order cross section is evaluated at O(a) accuracy in the qq@+qg channel and at O(a?) accuracy in the gg + gqs channel. These finite-order calculations are performed with the phase-spae sliing method desribed in Se. II B. When integrated over all QT , as in the dσ/dQ distribution at large Q, the resummed logarithmi terms from higher orders in αs also agree with the CDF data in this Q range within experimental unertainties. The shape of do/dQ at small Q is affected by the cuts in Eq. on the transverse momenta py of the two photons. In addition to being responsible for the characteristic cutoff at Q * 27 GeV explained in the previous subsection, the cuts on the individual transverse momenta p7 also introduce a dependence of the invariant mass distribution on the shape of the Qr spectrum of the yy pairs. Because of this correlation between the Q and Qr distributions, the discontinuities in do/dQr as Qr — 0, when computed at finite order, make finite-order predictions for do/dQ somewhat unstable. The finite-order expectation for the transverse momentum distribution do/dQr (i.e., the integral of P(Q, Qr, y,Q.) over Q, y, and Q,, or P for brevity) is shown as a dashed curve in Fig. B(a). It exhibits an integrable singularity in the small-Qr limit. Terms with inverse power and logarithmic dependence on Qr, associated with initial-state radiation as Qr — 0, are extracted from P and form the asymptotic contribution, denoted as A (dotted curve). In the figure, both P and A are truncated at a small value of Qr, that is, not drawn all the way to Qr = 0. The curves for P and A are close at small values of Qr, signaling that the initial-state logarithmic singularities dominate the NLO distribution. The difference Y between the P and A distributions includes the finite regular terms not included in A and logarithmic terms from the final-state fragmentation singularities, with the latter subtracted when Qr < E%°, as described in Sec. The data clearly disfavor the fixed-order prediction in the region of low Qr. Figure 5(b) features the resummed W + Y contribution (solid curve). Resummation o he initial-state logarithmic terms renders W finite in the region of small Qr. The sum of W and Y includes the resummed initial-state singular contributions plus the remaining relevan erms in P. Since P provides a reliable fixed-order estimate at large Qr, we present our final resummed prediction by switching from W + Y to P at the point at which the two differential cross sections (as functions of Q, Qr and y) cross each other. In contrast to the fixed-order (dashed) curve P in Fig.[{b), the agreement with data is improved at the lowes values of Qr, where resummation brings the rate down, and for Qr = 12 — 32 GeV, where he resummed logarithmic terms increase the rate. The resummed preditions for the Tevatron experiments are pratially insensitive to the the total rate at the Tevatron with CDF uts imposed omes from the q¯q+qg+¯qg (gg+gqS) initial state. The frations for the uts used by DØ are 84% and 16%. The gg + gqS ontribution falls steeply after QT > 22 GeV, beause the gluon PDF dereases rapidly with parton frational momentum x [3℄. The distribution in the difference Ay of the azimuthal angles of the photons is shown in Fig. [6 As is true for the transverse momentum distribution in the limit Qr — 0, the distribution computed at fixed order is ill-defined at Ay = 7. The resummed distribution shows a larger cross section near Ay = 2.5 rad, in better agreement with the data. In the region of small Ay < 7/2, the fixed-order and the resummed predictions are the same, a result of our matching of the resummed and fixed-order distributions at mid to high values of Qr. Although the cross section is not large in the region Ay < 7/2, there is an indication of a difference between our predictions and data in this region, a topic we address below. It is evident from Fig. 3 that the ∆ϕ < π/2 region is populated mostly by events with QT > Q. New types of radiative ontributions may be present in this region, inluding various fragmentation ontributions desribed in Se. II C and enhanements at large | cosθ∗| in the While experimental isolation generally suppresses long-distance fragmentation, a greater traction of fragmentation photons are expected to survive isolation when Ay < 7/2. Besides single-photon ‘one-fragmentation’ and ‘two-fragmentation’ contributions (with one photon er fragmenting parton), one encounters additional logarithmic singularities of the form og(Q/Qr). We noted in Sec. [1 Clthat these logarithms are associated with the fragmentation of a parton carrying large transverse momentum Q, into a system of small invariant mass Q (27, , alight yy pair in our case. Small-Q yy fragmentation of this kind is not implemented yet in theoretical models. Therefore, we are prepared for the possibility that both the fixed-order calculation and our resummed calculation may be deficient in the region Qr > Q. A detailed experimental study of the region Qr > Q may offer the opportunity to measure the parton to two-photon fragmentation function D,,(z1, 22), provided that the single-photon `one-fragmentation' funtion Dγ(z) is determined by single-photon data, and the low-Q logarithmi terms are properly resummed theoretially. In addition to the low-Q fragmentation, the small-∆ϕ region may be sensitive to large u-hannel exhanges in the q¯q t- or γγ and → higher-order ontributions assoiated with t- and γγ subproesses. In the Born proesses in Figs. 1(a) and (h), the gg u-hannel → π. These singularities are exluded by the pγ singularities arise at cosθ∗ ≈ ± 1 and ∆ϕ b b T ≈ b b uts in Eq.

We handle the collinear final-state photon singularities in the manner described in Sec. [I] without including photon fragmentation functions explicitly. An alternative calculation implemented in the DIPHOX code includes NLO cross sections for single-photon fragmentation processes. Neither code includes a term in which both photons are fragmentation products of the same final- state parton, i.e., the diphoton fragmentation function D,,(z1, 22). In Ref. 2 we show comparisons of our predictions with those of DIPHOX along with the CDF data. Here in Fig. [7] we show analogous plots of the invariant mass and transverse mo- mentum distributions for DO cuts. We note that our fixed-order g¢+ qg contribution agrees well with the direct contribution in DIPHOX. This agreement is particularly impressive in the region of large Qr, where both codes use the same fixed-order formalism to handle direct contributions. A contribution from the gg channel is also present in both codes, computed at LO in DIPHOX but at NLO+NNLL in our case. Since the gg + gqs contribution is not dominant (especially in the high Qr region), this difference does not have a significant impact on the comparison. fragmentation' ontribution) are quite small for the nominal hadroni energy Eiso 1 GeV T ∼ Eiso in the one around eah photon.

These are the hoies made in the CDF study [1℄. Sine Eiso T is an approximate harateristi of the experimental isolation, one might argue that both Eiso T = 1 and 4 GeV an be appropriate in a alulation to math the onditions of the CDF measurement. The diret ontribution is weakly sensitive to Eiso T , while the one-fragmentation part of dσ/dQT is roughly proportional to Eiso T (f. Setion II C). The one-fragmentation ontribution is enhaned on average by 400% if Eiso T is inreased in the alulation from 1 to 4 GeV. The rate in the shoulder region is enhaned further if the fatorization sale µF is redued. Since the theoretical specifications for isolation and for the fragmentation contribution are admittedly approximate, we question whether great importance should be placed on the agreement of theory and experiment in the region of small Ay or in the shoulder region in the Qr distribution. A straightforward way to reduce sensitivity to fragmentation is to require Q > 27 GeV or Qr < Q, as discussed above. The two cuts have similar effects on he event distributions. Figure [8] shows the effects of the Qr < Q cut on the Qr and Ay distributions. The cut Qr < Q is particularly efficient at suppressing the fragmentation Q; shoulder (and the region of small Ay altogether), while only a small portion of the event sample is lost. This cut is especially favorable, since it constrains the comparison with data o a region where the theory is well understood and has a small uncertainty. Furthermore, with the requirement of Qr < Q, the dependence of differential cross sections on the choices of isolation energy Ei? and factorization scale jr is greatly reduced to the typical size of higher-order corrections. We predict that if a Qr < Q cut, or a Q > 27 GeV cut, is applied o the Tevatron data, the enhancement at low Ay and intermediate Qr associated with the ragmentation contribution will disappear. This is an important conclusion of our study, and we urge the CDF and D@ collaborations to apply these cuts in their future analyses of the An important prediction of the resummation formalism is the change of the transverse momentum distribution with the diphoton invariant mass. This dependence comes, in part, rom the In Q? dependence in the Sudakov exponent, Eq. (17), and it is desirable to identify his feature amid other influences. In Fig. (a), we show normalized resummed transverse momentum distributions for various selections of the invariant mass of the photon pairs. Without kinematical constraints on the decay photons, the Qr distribution is expected to broaden with increasing Q, and the position of the peak in do/dQr to shift to larger Qr values. The shift of the peak may or may not be observed in the data depending on the chosen lower cuts on pr of the photons, which suppress the event rate at low Q and Qr. The interplay of the Sudakov broadening of the Qr distribution and kinematical suppression by he photon pr cuts is reflected in the shape of do/dQr in different Q bins. where the scaling function F(Q/V'S) reflects phase space constraints, dependence on the Sudakoy logarithm, and the a dependence of the PDFs. Figure [Q(b) shows our calculated diphoton mass dependence of (Qr). The linear increase shown in Eq. is observed over the range 30 < Q < 80 GeV. For values of Q below the kinematic cutoff at about 30 GeV, the cuts shown in Fig. 3 suppress diphoton production at small Qr, and (Qr/Q) grows toward 1 as Q decreases (corresponding to production only at Qr close to Q). For Q ~ 80 GeV and above, we see a saturation of the growth of (Qr), a reflection of the influences of the x dependence of the PDFs and other factors. Similar saturation behavior is observed in calculations of (Qr) in other processes . It would be interesting to see a comparison of our prediction with data from the CDF and D@ collaborations. The cuts listed above, optimized for the Higgs boson search, may require adjustments in order to test perturbative QCD predictions in the full yy invariant mass range accessible at he LHC. The values of the p> cuts on the photons in Eq. preserve a large fraction of Higgs boson events with Q > 115 GeV. These cuts may be too restrictive in studies of yy roduction at smaller Q, considering that the two final-state photons most likely originate rom a 77 pair with small Qr and have similar values of py of about Q/2. The pr cuts interfere with the expected Sudakov broadening of Qr distributions with increasing diphoton invariant mass, as discussed in Section [[1.A 5| We further note that the asymmetry between he p}. cuts on the harder and softer photons is necessary in a fixed-order perturbative QCD calculation, but it is not required in the resummed calculation. At a fixed order of as, asymmetry in the pp cuts prevents instabilities in do/dQ caused by logarithmic divergences in do/dQr at small Qr. Such instabilities are eliminated altogether once the small-Qr logarithmic terms are resummed to all orders of a,. Here we do not consider alternative py cuts, although experimental collaborations are encouraged to employ relaxed and/or symmetric cuts to increase the yy event sample in their data analysis. variant masses. The average γγ transverse momentum grows with Q, as demonstrated by Fig. 11. However, the rate of the growth dereases monotonially with Q, for similar reasons as at the Tevatron. The yy distributions in Q and Ay for different combinations of scattering subchannels and choices of theoretical parameters are discussed in Refs. [2,|3]. In all ranges of Q, the yy production rate is dominated by a large qg contribution, accounting for about 50% of the fixed-order (NLO) rate. Although this number depends on the choice of the factorization scheme and scale, and, on the other hand, separate treatment of the gg and qg cross sections is not meaningful in the resummation calculation [3], it nonetheless reflects, in a crude way, the increased relative importance of the gg cross section. The gg + gqs channel contributes about 25% at Q ~ 80 GeV (the location of the cutoff in da/dQ due to the cuts on py) and less at larger Q. As at the Tevatron, the dependence of the cross sections on the resummation scheme is small ia]. The dependence on the nonperturbative model can also be neglected, as long as the nonperturbative function does not vary strongly with x [3]. our results with DIPHOX preditions. The transverse momentum and invariant mass dis- tributions in the q¯q + qg hannel from the two approahes are shown in Fig. 12. In both state photons and partons when QT > Eiso T = 15 GeV, but not when QT is below Eiso T . Concentrating first on yy events with Q; > E'$?, we observe that, at Qr > 80 GeV, the resummed q¢+qg cross section reduces to the direct fixed-order cross section, evaluated in the same way as in the DIPHOX code. Our resummed and the direct DIPHOX cross sections, shown as solid and dashed curves, respectively, in Fig. 12a) consequently agree well at large Qr. At smaller Q7, the resummed cross section is enhanced by towers of higher-order logarithmic contributions. On the other hand, the full gg + gg DIPHOX rate (shown as a dotted line) also includes single-photon fragmentation contributions, which add to the direct production cross section. For the nominal isolation parameters, the explicit fragmentation contribution constitutes about 25% of the full DIPHOX rate for 60 < Qr < 120 GeV. Its magnitude increases approximately linearly with the assumed E%%° value. For Qr < E%?, the final-state collinear region of the direct contribution is regulated by the collinear subtraction prescription adopted in the resummation calculation, whereas the fragmentation singularity is subtracted from the direct contribution and replaced by photon fragmentation functions in the DIPHOX calculation. Subtraction of singularities in DIPHOX introduces integrable singularities in dx/dQr at different values of Qr below EX?. The origin of the final-state logarithmic singularities at values of Qr below E’{? is discussed in Refs. (22), (23), {24}. For Qr < E¥8?, the DIPHOX curves represent the average over singular contributions in this Q;r interval. After the fragmentation singularity is subtracted, the DIPHOX direct contribution (dashed line) is on average below our resummed qq + qg rate (solid line) over most of the range of Qr shown in Fig.[12(a). After integration over all Q7, our resummed and DIPHOX qq + ag cross sections agree within 10-20% at most values of Q (cf. Fig. [12(b)), with our resummed rate being below the DIPHOX rate at all Q. The largest difference occurs at the lowest values of Q (below the cutoff), where the rates can differ by a factor of 2. In this region, corresponding to diphoton events with small Ay and Qr larger than Q, the photon ragmentation contributions included in the DIPHOX calculation are large in comparison to he direct rate. Finally, we note that the integrated rate in DIPHOX is more stable with respect to variations in E%° than the differential distributions in DIPHOX, because ES? dependence for Qr > E%° is canceled to a good degree by E#8? dependence for Qr < EX?. To obtain the final yy production cross sections, after inclusion of all channels, we combine he respective gg+qg results with the resummed NLO gg+ gqs cross section in our case and with the LO gg cross section in the DIPHOX case. The distributions in the yy invariant mass Q, the transverse momentum Qr, and the azimuthal angle separation Ay in the lab rame are shown in Fig. For the cuts chosen, the LO gg and the resummed gg+ gqg total rates constitute about 9% and 20% of the total rate. The resummed and DIPHOX invariant mass distributions (Fig. [[3{a)) are brought closer to one another as a result of the inclusion of the gg + gqs contribution in the resummed calculation. For Qr ¥ 0, the full DIPHOX Qr distribution in Fig. [I3{b) is determined entirely by direct plus fragmentation contributions (the same as in Fig. [12(a)), because the LO gg cross section contributes at Qr = 0 only. In contrast, our resummed gg + gqs contribution modifies the event rate at all Qr. The resummed and DIPHOX rates are in a reasonable agreement for 1.5 < Ay < 2.5, as shown in Fig. [13(c). In the Ay — 7 limit, the fixed-order rates in DIPHOX diverge because of the singularities at small Q7, while our resummed rate yields a finite value. For Ay < 1.5, the DIPHOX cross section is enhanced by photon fragmentation contributions. As at the energy of the Tevatron, theoretical uncertainties are greater at small Ay. Predictions are most reliable when Qr < Q (and the angles 0, and y, are away from 0 or 7). With the Qr < Q cut imposed, the uncertain large-Qr photon fragmentation contributions are suppressed, and the resummed and DIPHOX cross sections agree well at large Qr (cf. Fig. [4(b)). The Qr distribution in the interval 70 < Q < 115 GeV with the Qr < Q constraint is shown in Fig. [10] by a dotted curve. Distributions in the other two mass bins in Fig. [10] are essentially not affected by this cut in the Qr range presented. Our alulation aptures the dominant ontributions to γγ prodution at the LHC. How- ever, as we noted, diret qg sattering, evaluated at order O (αs) in our alulation, is the behind the enhanement of the qg rate, whih is inreased predominantly by ontributions from non-singular phase spae regions. Consequently, the q¯q + qg diret rate is only weakly sensitive to adjustments in the isolation parameters Eiso T and ∆R [10℄. The unknown O ontributions to qg sattering may be non-negligible, and it would be valuable to ompute (α2 s) Higgs boson signal and the QCD bakground disussed in this paper. We fous on the anism, gg → h0 → γγ , where the Higgs boson prodution ross setion is alulated at the ontributions at O(α3 s) (NLO) and resummed ontributions at NNLL auray. These on- tributions are also coded in RESBos 33], and we can apply the same cuts on the momenta of the photons to the signal and background. Our findings should remain broadly applicable after the NNLO corrections to Higgs boson production [30 are included. We compute the background in the range 128 < Q < 132 GeV, and the signal at a fixed Higgs boson mass my = 130 GeV. We impose the kinematic selection Qr < Q, but its influence is not important at the large values of diphoton mass of interest here. b The cross section times branching ratio for the Higgs boson signal is substantially smaller than the QCD continuum. To better illustrate their differences, Fig.[5]presents distributions normalized to the respective total rates. The top-left panel shows normalized transverse momentum distributions of photon pairs. The signal and background peak at about 12 and 5 GeV, respectively. The average values of Qr are 26 and 23 GeV, computed over the range 0 to 75 GeV. Differences in the shapes of these Qr spectra can be attributed to the different structure of the leading terms in the initial-state Sudakov exponents and to the effects of final-state photon fragmentation. The Higgs boson signal is controlled by the characteristics of the 99+ 94s initial state, whereas the continuum is controlled primarily by the g¢+qq initial state. Because the dominant Sudakov coefficient A x Cr in the qq case is smaller than Aw) = (C4/Cr) A in the gg case, the resummed gq + qq initial-state radiation produces narrower Qr distributions than gg + gqg initial-state radiation. About 80% of the diphoton rate is provided by the qq+ qg channel, implying a narrower Qr distribution of the background, if based on the value of A“) alone. The continuum background contribution is also enhanced by final-state radiation in qg scattering. The Qr profile of the final-state collinear terms depends more on the isolation model (including £8? and AR) than on the initial-state Sudakov exponent. For the nominal ATLAS cuts, the final-state collinear contribution in our calculation hardens the background Qr distribution, diminishing its difference from the Higgs boson signal distribution. More effective isolation may reduce the impact of the final-state radiation on Q7 distributions. Another difference between the signal and continuum is observed in the distribution in he azimuthal angle of the photons, such as the angle y, in the Collins-Soper frame shown in the top-right panel of Fig. 15} This distribution is qualitatively the same if integrated over all Qr, as in Fig. or integrated above some minimal Qr value, as in an experimental measurement. Without isolation imposed, the spin-0 Higgs boson signal must be flat in »., but the QCD background peaks toward y, = 0 and 7 (i.e., siny, = 0) as a result of the final-state gg singularity.” * Isolation cuts suppress both the signal and the background for siny, <sin AR. The result is a signal distribution with a broad peak near yp. = 7/2, while he background favors values of y, near 0 and z. A selection of events with y, in the vicinity of 7/2, and Qr large enough, helps to reduce the impact of the gg background.In the lab rame, a related distribution is in the variable |y3r — Yar| ,where yir is the azimuthal angle between py and Or. The signal (background) processes tend to have more events with large A third potential discriminator between the signal and background is the difference in the rapidities Ay = Ynara — Ysofi Of the photons with harder and softer values of Dr in the lab frame, calculated on an event by event basis. This distribution is displayed in the lower- left frame of Fig. The background distribution peaks at the origin, while the signal is almost flat over a wide range of Ay. Different spin correlations in the decay of a spin-0 Higgs boson from those characteristic of QCD background processes are the source of this distinction. Discrimination based on this difference can improve the statistical significance of the signal . We note that our resummed calculation does not exhibit the kinematic singularity at Ay ~ 2 present in the finite-order cross section and obvious in Fig. 10 of Ref. iid), where the distribution with respect to y* = Ay/2 is shown. The discontinuity in da /dQr caused by the finite-order approximation is resummed in our calculation, yielding a smooth result. A omparison of QT distributions in the top-left panel of Fig. 15 suggests that the signal versus bakground ratio would be enhaned if a ut is made to restrit QT > 10 GeV. QT , ϕ∗, and cosθ∗ distributions are good disriminators between the Higgs boson signal and The theoretial study of ontinuum diphoton prodution in hadron ollisions is interesting diphotons are a large standard-model bakground above whih one may observe the produts In this paper and Refs. bo Bh, we present our calculation of the fully differential cross section da/(dQdQrdydQ.) as a function of the mass Q, transverse momentum Qr, and rapidity y of the diphoton system, and of the polar and azimuthal angles of the individual photons in the diphoton rest frame. Our basic QCD hard-scattering subprocesses are all computed at next-to-leading order (NLO) in the strong coupling strength a,, and we include the state-of-art resummation of initial-state gluon radiation to all orders in a,, valid to next- to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy (NNLL). Resummation is essential for a realistic and reliable calculation of the Qr dependence in the region of small and intermediate values of Qr, where the cross section is greatest. It is also needed for stable estimates of the effects of Our analytical results are included in a fully updated RESBos code (31), 3g]. This nu- merical program allows us to impose selections on the transverse momenta and angles of the final photons, in order to match those employed by the CDF and D@ collaborations, as well as those anticipated in experiments at the LHC. Our predictions are especially pertinent in he region Qr < Q. We show that our results at the Tevatron and at the LHC are insensitive o the choice of the resummation scheme and of the nonperturbative functions required by he integration into the region of large impact parameter. The published collider data are presented in the form of singly differential distributions. We follow suit in order to make comparisons, and we find excellent agreement with data, as shown in Sec. We recommend that more differential studies be made, and, to motivate hese, we present predictions for the changes expected in the Qr distribution as a function of mass Q, and for the dependence of the mean transverse momentum on Q. Another approach to the computation of continuum diphoton production is presented by the DIPHOX collaboration . This calculation includes both the direct production of photons from hard-scattering processes and the photons produced from fragmentation of (anti-)quarks or gluons. It is valid at NLO, except for the gg subprocess, which is included at leading order only. The DIPHOX code is useful for rates integrated over transverse mo- mentum, but it is not designed to predict the transverse momentum distribution or other distributions sensitive to the region in which the transverse momentum of the diphoton pair is small. Compared to a fixed-order calculation, such as direct photon pair calculation in DIPHOXx, our calculation improves the theoretical prediction for event distributions which are sensitive to the region of low Qr. Furthermore, our calculation includes the NLO con- tribution from the combined gg + gqs channel, leading to more accurate predictions at the LHC, where the gg + gqs contribution is generally not small. long-distane dynamis of QCD. The isolated diphoton prodution rate is modeled in the parton showering in the presene of isolation onstraints. There is inevitable ambiguity and Se. III, the DIPHOX ross setion an vary by a large fator in some regions of phase spae at the Tevatron when Eiso is hanged from 1 GeV to 4 GeV. Our approach is to concentrate on physical observables which are less sensitive to the frag- mentation contributions. We apply the “collinear subtraction” prescription or the “smooth- cone isolation” prescription to define an isolated photon in our calculation. We find good agreement with the data, exept in the region with small Q and ∆ϕ < π/2, onsistent with tation ontributions an strongly modify the rate of diphoton pairs in this region. We suggest that muh better agreement with urrent and future data will be obtained if an addition requirement of QT < Q is applied. With this ut, the fragmentation ontributions are largely suppressed. With the ut QT < Q ut applied to the Tevatron data, the enhanement at low ∆ϕ and intermediate QT (the shoulder region) should disappear. We urge the CDF and DØ ollaborations to apply these uts in future analyses of the diphoton data. In our calculation, we identify an interesting spin-flip contribution (with cos 2, depen- dence) in the gg channel, cf. Ref. [3], and we suggest that measurements be made of the distribution of y. as a function of Qr. All-orders resummation of the gluon spin-flip contri- bution may be needed when a larger statistical sample of diphoton data is available. The contributions from gg + gg processes become more important at the LHC than at the Tevatron, and calculations at a higher order of precision may be warranted eventually. To improve the theoretical prediction in the region of phase space with Q < ES? and yp. ~ 0 or 7, a joint resummation calculation is needed in which the effects of both the initial- and final-state multiple parton emissions are treated simultaneously. Although we emphasize that better agreement of our predictions with data should be apparent if the selection Qr < Q is made, we also point out that the region Qr > Q should manifest very interesting physics of a different sort. Additional logarithmic singularities of the form log(Q/Qr) are encountered in the region Qr >> Q. These logarithms are associated with the fragmentation of a_parton carrying large transverse momentum Qr into a system of small invariant mass Q |27, |28], a light yy pair in our case. Small-Q yy fragmentation of this kind is not implemented yet in theoretical models. Experimental study of the region Qr > Q may offer the opportunity to measure the parton to two-photon fragmentation function D,.(21, 22). ===acknowledgments=== The value of a perturbative coefficient F) for a set of scales C,/b and C2Q can be expressed in terms of its value F(° obtained for the “canonical” combination C,; = cy and Cy = 1.
