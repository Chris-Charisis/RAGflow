        "abstract": "Mushrooms contain valuable nutrients, proteins, minerals, and vitamins, and it is suggested to include them in our diet. Many farmers grow mushrooms in restricted environments with specific atmospheric parameters in greenhouses. In addition, recent technologies of the Internet of things intend to give solutions in the agriculture area. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of machine learning for mushroom growth monitoring for the genus Pleurotus. We use YOLOv5 to detect mushrooms' growing stage and indicate those ready to harvest. The results show that it can detect mushrooms in the greenhouse with an F1-score of up to 76.5%. The classification in the final stage of mushroom growth gives an accuracy of up to 70%, which is acceptable considering the complexity of the photos used. In addition, we propose a method for mushroom growth monitoring based on Detectron2. Our method shows that the average growth period of the mushrooms is 5.22 days. Moreover, our method is also adequate to indicate the harvesting day. The evaluation results show that it could improve the time to harvest for 14.04% of the mushrooms.",

        "text": " the growing days may not be counted precisely in some mushrooms. For example, some mushrooms may appear a few hours after a picture was taken, resulting in a day count less than the actual growth duration. Moreover, some mushrooms may have been harvested just before a picture was taken, also resulting in reduced count days. Therefore, capturing photos of the substrate bags more often could give better results and inform more precisely about the growing rate of the mushroom and the harvesting time. Finally, the results of the mushroom detection are not always precise. In fact, the proposed method has two minor drawbacks. First, some of the mushrooms that were too small could not be detected. In addition, the masks returned from Detectron2 were not always accurate. We believe that both these drawbacks do not have a large impact on the proposed methodology. However, if we need to improve them, we could use a larger dataset with more annotated mushrooms to get better results. ===conclusions=== Object detection and instance segmentation have multiple applications in various domains. In smart farming, it is mainly used in fruit detection, weed detection, or pest detection. In this paper"
