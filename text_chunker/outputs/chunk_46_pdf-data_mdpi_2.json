        "abstract": "Fluorescent labels, commonly used in highly sensitive analytical techniques for detecting and tracking biomolecules in critical fields like cellular biology, medicine, medicinal chemistry, and environmental science, are currently too expensive for routine use in standard applications, with most exhibiting small Stokes shifts. This limitation underscores the potential of 4-diethylaminobenzaldehyde derivatives as a cost-effective alternative for developing new, bright fluorophores with larger Stokes shifts. In this work, using 4-diethylaminobenzaldehyde as starting material, we developed a simple, cost-effective, and efficient synthetic strategy to produce new affordable small molecules as effective fluorescent labels for biomolecules. Density functional theory and time-dependent density functional theory calculations were also conducted to gain insights into the observed photophysical properties.",

Extending the \u03c0-conjugated system in these molecules was essential to facilitate the effective intramolecular charge transfer process of the emissive excited state, improving their photophysical properties, including high molar extinction coefficients and large Stokes shifts. The new fluorescent labels demonstrate high efficacy as RNA-FISH probes, enabling the specific detection of microbial cells. Some of the synthesized probes exhibited a similar proportion of fluorescent cells comparable to Cy3\u00ae, one of the most widely used, and expensive, commercial fluorescent labels. The slightly lower efficiency observed in the synthesized probes derived from the fluorescent markers containing derivative 10 may be due to the low value of its fluorescence quantum yield. Considering that FISH is a c"
