Our basic QCD hard-scattering subprocesses are all computed at next-to-leading order (NLO) in the strong coupling strength a,, and we include the state-of-art resummation of initial-state gluon radiation to all orders in a,, valid to next- to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy (NNLL). Resummation is essential for a realistic and reliable calculation of the Qr dependence in the region of small and intermediate values of Qr, where the cross section is greatest. It is also needed for stable estimates of the effects of Our analytical results are included in a fully updated RESBos code (31), 3g]. This nu- merical program allows us to impose selections o"
