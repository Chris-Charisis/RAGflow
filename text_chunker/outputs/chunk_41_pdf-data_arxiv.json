Neither code includes a term in which both photons are fragmentation products of the same final- state parton, i.e., the diphoton fragmentation function D,,(z1, 22). In Ref. 2 we show comparisons of our predictions with those of DIPHOX along with the CDF data. Here in Fig. [7] we show analogous plots of the invariant mass and transverse mo- mentum distributions for DO cuts. We note that our fixed-order g\u00a2+ qg contribution agrees well with the direct contribution in DIPHOX. This agreement is particularly impressive in the region of large Qr, where both codes use the same fixed-order formalism to handle direct contributions. A contribution from the gg channel is also present in both codes, computed at LO in DIPHOX but at NLO+NNLL in our case. Since the gg + gqs contribution is not dominant (especially in the high Qr region), this difference does not have a significant impact on the comparison. fragmentation' ontribution) are quite small for the nominal hadroni energy Eiso 1 GeV T \u223c Eiso in the one around eah photon.
