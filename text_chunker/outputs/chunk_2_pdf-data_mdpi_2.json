        "abstract": "Fluorescent labels, commonly used in highly sensitive analytical techniques for detecting and tracking biomolecules in critical fields like cellular biology, medicine, medicinal chemistry, and environmental science, are currently too expensive for routine use in standard applications, with most exhibiting small Stokes shifts. This limitation underscores the potential of 4-diethylaminobenzaldehyde derivatives as a cost-effective alternative for developing new, bright fluorophores with larger Stokes shifts. In this work, using 4-diethylaminobenzaldehyde as starting material, we developed a simple, cost-effective, and efficient synthetic strategy to produce new affordable small molecules as effective fluorescent labels for biomolecules. Density functional theory and time-dependent density functional theory calculations were also conducted to gain insights into the observed photophysical properties.",

These breakthroughs frequently depend on fluorescence-based imaging methodologies, that allow us to identify, observe, and analyze the morphological and dynamic aspects of biology at the molecular level through multi- dimensional approaches [4,5]. Due to their rapid response and high sensitivity, fluorescent probes offer several advantages for visualizing spatiotemporal alterations in biological systems and they have therefore become indispensable tools in the field of molecular biology and medicine, demonstrating their diagnostic and even clinical utility [6\u201312]. Fluo- rescent small organic molecules serve a multitude of purposes across a diverse range of experiments, including cellular staining, identifying specific bio-analytes, and monitoring biomolecules of significance. This makes them particularly appealing to organic chemists, given their numerous advantages over other imaging systems, such as their small size, chemical tunability, ease of use, and how they are often obtained through simple s"
