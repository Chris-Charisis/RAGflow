        "abstract": "Mushrooms contain valuable nutrients, proteins, minerals, and vitamins, and it is suggested to include them in our diet. Many farmers grow mushrooms in restricted environments with specific atmospheric parameters in greenhouses. In addition, recent technologies of the Internet of things intend to give solutions in the agriculture area. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of machine learning for mushroom growth monitoring for the genus Pleurotus. We use YOLOv5 to detect mushrooms' growing stage and indicate those ready to harvest. The results show that it can detect mushrooms in the greenhouse with an F1-score of up to 76.5%. The classification in the final stage of mushroom growth gives an accuracy of up to 70%, which is acceptable considering the complexity of the photos used. In addition, we propose a method for mushroom growth monitoring based on Detectron2. Our method shows that the average growth period of the mushrooms is 5.22 days. Moreover, our method is also adequate to indicate the harvesting day. The evaluation results show that it could improve the time to harvest for 14.04% of the mushrooms.",

The horizontal axis corresponds to the con\ufb01dence of the detected mushrooms, while the vertical axis corresponds to the F1-score. In this example, the maximum F1-score had a con\ufb01dence of 0.566. In addition, the graph shows that the class \u201cStage1\u201d had a better accuracy. This was expected since all photos with mushrooms belonging to \u201cStage1\u201d were simpler, as mushrooms were small and not overlapping. To notice the detection accuracy for each class more clearly, Figure 8 presents the confusion matrix for the same con\ufb01guration. It shows that class \u201cStage1\u201d had an accuracy of 82%, class \u201cStage2\u201d had an accuracy of 71%, and \u201cStage3\u201d had an accuracy of 70%. Although this does not seem perfect, we can say that it was good enough depending on the complexity of the photos with mushrooms in \u201cStage2\u201d and \u201cStage3\u201d. Figure 9 shows an example of the detection where only mushrooms from classes Stage2 and Stage3 exist. The green bounding box indicates that the mushroom is ready to harvest (Stage3). The blue bounding box indicates that the mushroom is not yet ready to harvest (Stage2). We marked in magenta the"
