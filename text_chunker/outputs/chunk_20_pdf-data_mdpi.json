        "abstract": "Mushrooms contain valuable nutrients, proteins, minerals, and vitamins, and it is suggested to include them in our diet. Many farmers grow mushrooms in restricted environments with specific atmospheric parameters in greenhouses. In addition, recent technologies of the Internet of things intend to give solutions in the agriculture area. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of machine learning for mushroom growth monitoring for the genus Pleurotus. We use YOLOv5 to detect mushrooms' growing stage and indicate those ready to harvest. The results show that it can detect mushrooms in the greenhouse with an F1-score of up to 76.5%. The classification in the final stage of mushroom growth gives an accuracy of up to 70%, which is acceptable considering the complexity of the photos used. In addition, we propose a method for mushroom growth monitoring based on Detectron2. Our method shows that the average growth period of the mushrooms is 5.22 days. Moreover, our method is also adequate to indicate the harvesting day. The evaluation results show that it could improve the time to harvest for 14.04% of the mushrooms.",

Next, we performed a resize operation on the bounding box and the masks to achieve normalisation for calculating the size in all photos of the same substrate grow bag. Furthermore, the detected mushrooms were distinguished in one of the rectangles with the following rules. A mushroom should have more than 50% in the speci\ufb01c rectangle. Only one mushroom can belong in one rectangle, and each mushroom belongs only in one rectangle. In any case, the selected mushroom was the one that covered the most area in the rectangle. Finally, Figure 6c illustrates the divided bounding box with the corresponding masks of all detected masks. The size of the provided mask could indicate the size of the mushroom. After distinguishing each mushroom, we calculated the coverage based on the pixels of the provided mask and used it for mushroom growth monitoring. ===results=== In the following subsections, we evaluate the results of the mushroom classi\ufb01cation for different growth stages. Next, we provide the results of mushroo"
