        "abstract": "Mushrooms contain valuable nutrients, proteins, minerals, and vitamins, and it is suggested to include them in our diet. Many farmers grow mushrooms in restricted environments with specific atmospheric parameters in greenhouses. In addition, recent technologies of the Internet of things intend to give solutions in the agriculture area. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of machine learning for mushroom growth monitoring for the genus Pleurotus. We use YOLOv5 to detect mushrooms' growing stage and indicate those ready to harvest. The results show that it can detect mushrooms in the greenhouse with an F1-score of up to 76.5%. The classification in the final stage of mushroom growth gives an accuracy of up to 70%, which is acceptable considering the complexity of the photos used. In addition, we propose a method for mushroom growth monitoring based on Detectron2. Our method shows that the average growth period of the mushrooms is 5.22 days. Moreover, our method is also adequate to indicate the harvesting day. The evaluation results show that it could improve the time to harvest for 14.04% of the mushrooms.",

We captured a photo for each one on seven different days between 16 August 2022 and 24 August 2022. Finally, we collected 231 different photos in total. The distance between the camera and the substrate grow bag was one meter above. Figure 3 shows an example of three captured photos. We did not annotate these photos, but we used the trained models from Detectron2 to indicate the size of each mushroom. In our evaluation for mushroom growth monitoring, we used only the mushrooms that were on top of the substrate grow bag. For training Detectron2 for instance segmentation, we annotated another two datasets. The \ufb01rst one contained annotations for substrate grow bags, and the second one contained annotations for mushrooms. The annotation process for the image segmentation is a time- consuming task since we had to annotate precisely the objects with polygons. For that reason, we chose to annotate only photos that contained a small number of mushrooms to simplify the annotation. Finally, we annotated 453 mushrooms and divided them in"
