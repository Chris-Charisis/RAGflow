        "abstract": "Mushrooms contain valuable nutrients, proteins, minerals, and vitamins, and it is suggested to include them in our diet. Many farmers grow mushrooms in restricted environments with specific atmospheric parameters in greenhouses. In addition, recent technologies of the Internet of things intend to give solutions in the agriculture area. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of machine learning for mushroom growth monitoring for the genus Pleurotus. We use YOLOv5 to detect mushrooms' growing stage and indicate those ready to harvest. The results show that it can detect mushrooms in the greenhouse with an F1-score of up to 76.5%. The classification in the final stage of mushroom growth gives an accuracy of up to 70%, which is acceptable considering the complexity of the photos used. In addition, we propose a method for mushroom growth monitoring based on Detectron2. Our method shows that the average growth period of the mushrooms is 5.22 days. Moreover, our method is also adequate to indicate the harvesting day. The evaluation results show that it could improve the time to harvest for 14.04% of the mushrooms.",

Figure 1 shows some examples of mushrooms belonging to the three different stages. Many of the collected photos in the greenhouse contained multiple mushrooms, making the annotation complex and the recognition even more challenging, especially when the mushrooms were at the \ufb01nal stage and many of them were overlapping. Figure 2 presents two of those photos as an example. Figure 2. Pictures from the greenhouse with multiple mushrooms. Finally, 4271 mushrooms were annotated and classi\ufb01ed into three different classes (Stage1, Stage2, Stage3) as described before. Moreover, 1130 of them belonged to the \ufb01rst growing stage, 1845 to the second growing stage, and 1296 of them to the third growing stage. In addition, the 1128 annotated photos were divided into 784 for the training dataset and 344 for the validation dataset. For the second part of our research, we collected a different set of photos. In particular, the data acquisition for the growing rate of mushrooms was made in 33 different mushroom substrate grow bags. We captured a photo for each one on seven "
