        "abstract": "Fluorescent labels, commonly used in highly sensitive analytical techniques for detecting and tracking biomolecules in critical fields like cellular biology, medicine, medicinal chemistry, and environmental science, are currently too expensive for routine use in standard applications, with most exhibiting small Stokes shifts. This limitation underscores the potential of 4-diethylaminobenzaldehyde derivatives as a cost-effective alternative for developing new, bright fluorophores with larger Stokes shifts. In this work, using 4-diethylaminobenzaldehyde as starting material, we developed a simple, cost-effective, and efficient synthetic strategy to produce new affordable small molecules as effective fluorescent labels for biomolecules. Density functional theory and time-dependent density functional theory calculations were also conducted to gain insights into the observed photophysical properties.",

        "text": " of prokaryotic (bacterial) cells, were sourced from Eurofins Scientific (Luxembourg City, Luxembourg) and STAB Vida (Caparica, Portu- gal). The required amount of N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (NHS) was calculated based on an 8-fold molar excess as follows: mass of NHS ester [mg] = 8 \u00d7 mass of modified oligonu- cleotide [mg] \u00d7 molar mass of NHS ester [g/mol]/molar mass of modified oligonucleotide [g/mol]. The total reaction volume was adjusted to achieve a final concentration of 200 \u00b5M. The NHS ester was dissolved in DMSO, constituting 1/10 of the total reaction volume, while the modified oligonucleotide was dissolved in a 0.1 M sodium bicarbonate solution, making up the remaining 9/10 of the total reaction volume. The NHS ester solution was introduced into the modified oligonucleotide solution and thoroughly stirred for 1 min using a vortex. The reaction mixture was stirred on an orbital shaker for 12 h at 20 \u25e6C, protected from light. Next, 1/10 volume of 3 M NaCl and 2.5 volumes of cold (\u221220 \u25e6C) absolute ethanol were added to the reaction mixture. The mixture was vortexed thoroughly and then incubated at \u221220 \u25e6C for 30 min. Following incubation, the reaction mixture was centrifuged "
