(7, ig}. as well as 4-leg two-loop diagrams (1) computed in Ref. ata In this study we also include subleading contributions from the process (k), 94s > Yy4s via the quark loop, where gg = >> combination of quark scattering channels. (qi + G) denotes the flavor-singlet i=u,d,s,... Factorization is a central principle of hadronic calculations in perturbative QCD, in which a high-energy scattering cross section is expressed as a convolution of a perturbative partonic cross section with nonperturbative parton distribution functions (PDFs), thus separating short-distance from long-distance physics. The common factorization is a longitudinal no- tion, in the sense that the convolution is an integral over longitudinal momentum fractions, even if some partons in the hard-scattering process have transverse momenta that border the nonperturbative regime. Unphysical features may then arise in the transverse momentum (Qr) distribution of a color-neutral object with high invariant mass (Q), such as a pair of photons produced in hadron-hadron collisions. When calculated in the common factorization approach at any finite order in perturbation theory, this distribution diverges as Qr"
