        "abstract": "Mushrooms contain valuable nutrients, proteins, minerals, and vitamins, and it is suggested to include them in our diet. Many farmers grow mushrooms in restricted environments with specific atmospheric parameters in greenhouses. In addition, recent technologies of the Internet of things intend to give solutions in the agriculture area. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of machine learning for mushroom growth monitoring for the genus Pleurotus. We use YOLOv5 to detect mushrooms' growing stage and indicate those ready to harvest. The results show that it can detect mushrooms in the greenhouse with an F1-score of up to 76.5%. The classification in the final stage of mushroom growth gives an accuracy of up to 70%, which is acceptable considering the complexity of the photos used. In addition, we propose a method for mushroom growth monitoring based on Detectron2. Our method shows that the average growth period of the mushrooms is 5.22 days. Moreover, our method is also adequate to indicate the harvesting day. The evaluation results show that it could improve the time to harvest for 14.04% of the mushrooms.",

Next, Section 5 presents the evaluation results between different con\ufb01gurations of YOLOv5 and its effectiveness on mushroom classi\ufb01cation at different stages of mushroom growth. In addition, we provide the results from Detectron2 on mushroom growth monitoring. Section 6 discusses the effectiveness of the proposed methods, their limitations and possible impact on future applications. Finally, Section 7 concludes this paper. ===related work=== In this section, we brie\ufb02y present similar research efforts in the area of smart farming, particularly in image processing or machine learning for image segmentation or object recognition on mushroom cultivation. A harvesting robot for oyster mushrooms was proposed in [21]. The development system used an improved SSD algorithm to detect mushrooms ready to harvest. The algorithm used RGB images and point clouds collected by an Intel RealSense D435i camera. The evaluation results showed an accuracy of mushroom recognition of up to 95.0% and a harvesting success rate of up to 86.8%. The average harvesting time for a single mushroom was 8.85 s.
