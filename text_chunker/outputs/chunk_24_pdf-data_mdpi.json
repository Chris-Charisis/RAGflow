        "abstract": "Mushrooms contain valuable nutrients, proteins, minerals, and vitamins, and it is suggested to include them in our diet. Many farmers grow mushrooms in restricted environments with specific atmospheric parameters in greenhouses. In addition, recent technologies of the Internet of things intend to give solutions in the agriculture area. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of machine learning for mushroom growth monitoring for the genus Pleurotus. We use YOLOv5 to detect mushrooms' growing stage and indicate those ready to harvest. The results show that it can detect mushrooms in the greenhouse with an F1-score of up to 76.5%. The classification in the final stage of mushroom growth gives an accuracy of up to 70%, which is acceptable considering the complexity of the photos used. In addition, we propose a method for mushroom growth monitoring based on Detectron2. Our method shows that the average growth period of the mushrooms is 5.22 days. Moreover, our method is also adequate to indicate the harvesting day. The evaluation results show that it could improve the time to harvest for 14.04% of the mushrooms.",

We marked in magenta the mushrooms that were detected in the wrong class. Moreover, we marked in red the mushrooms that were not detected. It seems from the photo that the mushrooms in the foreground were detected in the right class, while some errors occurred in mushrooms that were in the background or partially displayed. After the procedure described previously, we obtained 575 different masks from 114 different mushrooms in the greenhouse. All masks were distinguished for different mushrooms depending on the number of the substrate grow bag and the position on it. When the mask corresponded to the \ufb01rst day of appearance of each mushroom, it was marked as day one. The corresponding masks of the next days of the same mushroom were numbered as well in the same way. Figure 10 shows the growth rate of four different mushrooms. Each mushroom is indicated with a different colour. The horizontal axis of the graph contains the number of the growth day, starting from number one for the \ufb01rst day of the mushroom\u2019s ap"
