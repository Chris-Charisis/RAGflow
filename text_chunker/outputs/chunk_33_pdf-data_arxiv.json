Our theoretical framework is applicable in the region Qr < Q (large Ay), where the dominant fraction of events occurs. The appearance of singularities in the NLO calculation at Qr \u2014 0 and the fact that there are two different hard scales, Qr and Q, relevant for the event distributions in the low-Qr region require that we address and resum large logarithmic terms of the form log(Q/Qr).
