We use the W + Y cross section as our final prediction at Qr values below the crossing point, and the NLO cross section P at Qr values above the crossing point. A few comments are in order about our resummation calculation. The hard-vertex contri- bution U,(,)h2(Q, 6.) and the functions B, (C1, Co, ft) and Ca/a, (x, b; C/C2, ju) can be varied in a mutually compensating way while preserving the same value of the form factor W up to higher-order corrections in a,. This ambiguity, or dependence on the chosen \u201cresummation scheme\u201d within the CSS formalism, can be employed to explore the sensitivity of the- oretical predictions to further next-to-next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic (NNNLL) effects that are not accounted for explicitly. The perturbative coefficients in Appendix[Alare presented in the CSS resummation scheme (ul), our default choice in numerical calculations, and in an alternative scheme by Catani, de Florian and Grazzini (CFG) j2il]. In the original CSS resummation scheme, the B "
