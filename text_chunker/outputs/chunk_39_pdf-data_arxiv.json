[1 Clthat these logarithms are associated with the fragmentation of a parton carrying large transverse momentum Q, into a system of small invariant mass Q (27, , alight yy pair in our case. Small-Q yy fragmentation of this kind is not implemented yet in theoretical models. Therefore, we are prepared for the possibility that both the fixed-order calculation and our resummed calculation may be deficient in the region Qr > Q. A detailed experimental study of the region Qr > Q may offer the opportunity to measure the parton to two-photon fragmentation function D,,(z1, 22), provided that the single-photon `one-fragmentation' funtion D\u03b3(z) is determined by single-photon data, and the low-Q logarithmi terms are properly resummed theoretially. In addition to the low-Q fragmentation, the small-\u2206\u03d5 region may be sensitive to large u-hannel exhanges in the q\u00afq t- or \u03b3\u03b3 and \u2192 higher-order ontributions assoiated with t- and \u03b3\u03b3 subproesses.
