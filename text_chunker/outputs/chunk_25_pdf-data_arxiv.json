In our approach, we do not introduce fragmentation unctions, but we apply an auxiliary regulator to the direct gg cross section at Qr < E%? and Ar < AR. In our numerical study we find that this prescription preserves a continuous differential distribution except for a small finite discontinuity at Qr = E/S\u00b0. It approximately reproduces the integrated qg rate obtained in the DIPHOX calculation at small Qr, for the nominal E%\u00b0. = the leading part Eq.
