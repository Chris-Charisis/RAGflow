        "abstract": "Fluorescent labels, commonly used in highly sensitive analytical techniques for detecting and tracking biomolecules in critical fields like cellular biology, medicine, medicinal chemistry, and environmental science, are currently too expensive for routine use in standard applications, with most exhibiting small Stokes shifts. This limitation underscores the potential of 4-diethylaminobenzaldehyde derivatives as a cost-effective alternative for developing new, bright fluorophores with larger Stokes shifts. In this work, using 4-diethylaminobenzaldehyde as starting material, we developed a simple, cost-effective, and efficient synthetic strategy to produce new affordable small molecules as effective fluorescent labels for biomolecules. Density functional theory and time-dependent density functional theory calculations were also conducted to gain insights into the observed photophysical properties.",

The design of molecules with donor-\u03c0 bridge-acceptor (D-\u03c0-A) structures, as in this case, requires a strategic approach aimed at optimizing their electronic properties to increase fluorescence. In this work, we intend to develop a simple and effective synthetic strategy to pro- duce new cost-effective small molecules as fluorescent labels for biomolecules, using 4-diethylaminobenzaldehyde as a starting material. We also intend to evaluate the synthe- sized fluorescent labels as potentially effective fluorescent markers for biomolecules and compare their efficiency to Cy3\u00ae, one of the most used commercial fluorescent labels in a wide range of scientific applications. In the context of the FISH technique, six new fluo- rescent oligonucleotide probes were tested on microorganisms from the culture collection of the HERCULES Laboratory at the University of \u00c9vora. Three of these probes target the rRNA region of eukaryotic cells (EUK516), while the other three target the rRNA region of prokaryotic cells (EUB338). To provide additional insights to this study,"
