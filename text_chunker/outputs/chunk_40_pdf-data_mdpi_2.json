        "abstract": "Fluorescent labels, commonly used in highly sensitive analytical techniques for detecting and tracking biomolecules in critical fields like cellular biology, medicine, medicinal chemistry, and environmental science, are currently too expensive for routine use in standard applications, with most exhibiting small Stokes shifts. This limitation underscores the potential of 4-diethylaminobenzaldehyde derivatives as a cost-effective alternative for developing new, bright fluorophores with larger Stokes shifts. In this work, using 4-diethylaminobenzaldehyde as starting material, we developed a simple, cost-effective, and efficient synthetic strategy to produce new affordable small molecules as effective fluorescent labels for biomolecules. Density functional theory and time-dependent density functional theory calculations were also conducted to gain insights into the observed photophysical properties.",

Following incubation, the reaction mixture was centrifuged at 12,000\u00d7 g for 30 min, and the supernatant was carefully removed. The re- sulting fluorescent bioconjugate pellet was washed four times with 70% ethanol (4 \u00d7 1 mL) and then air-dried [35]. Universal probes were used as hybridization controls as follows: EUB338-Cy3 (5\u2032Cy3- GCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT-3\u2032), which targets the rRNA regions of prokaryotic (bacterial) of eukaryotic (yeast) cells. These probes feature a cyanine (Cy3\u00ae) fluorescent label attached to the 5\u2032 end of the oligonucleotide. The solutions required for the fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) procedure, specifically phosphate-buffered saline (PBS 10X) containing NaCl (130.0 mM), NaH2PO4 (8.0 mM), KCl (2.7 mM), KH2PO4 (1.5 mM) at pH 7.2, and the hybridization buffer (HB) consisting of NaCl (0.9 M), Tris-HCl (20 mM), and SDS (0.1%), were prepared in advance. The RNA-FISH methodology involves several preparatory steps, including: (i) fixation of sample cells, (ii) permeabilization of cells, (iii) hybridization with specific p"
