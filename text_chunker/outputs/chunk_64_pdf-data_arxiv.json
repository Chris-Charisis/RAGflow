        "text": " which the effects of both the initial- and final-state multiple parton emissions are treated simultaneously. Although we emphasize that better agreement of our predictions with data should be apparent if the selection Qr < Q is made, we also point out that the region Qr > Q should manifest very interesting physics of a different sort. Additional logarithmic singularities of the form log(Q/Qr) are encountered in the region Qr >> Q. These logarithms are associated with the fragmentation of a_parton carrying large transverse momentum Qr into a system of small invariant mass Q |27, |28], a light yy pair in our case. Small-Q yy fragmentation of this kind is not implemented yet in theoretical models. Experimental study of the region Qr > Q may offer the opportunity to measure the parton to two-photon fragmentation function D,.(21, 22). ===acknowledgments=== The value of a perturbative coefficient F) for a set of scales C,/b and C2Q can be expressed in terms of its value F(\u00b0 obtained for the \u201ccanonical\u201d combination C,; = cy and Cy = 1.
