When the photon-quark separation Ar = V(n5 \u2014 my)? + (es \u2014 5)? in the plane of pseudorapidity 7 = \u2014log(tan(@/2)) and azimuthal angle y in the lab frame is small, as in the collinear limit, sj; ~ Ep, ErsAr?, where Ey, and Fr; are the transverse energies of the photon and quark, with Ey = Esin@. Note that Ets = Qr at the order in a, at which we are working. Therefore, contributions from the final-state collinear, or fragmentation, region are most pronounced at small Ar and relatively small Qr.! A fully consistent treatment of the initial- and final-state singularities would require a joint initial- and final-state resummation. In the approaches taken to date, the fragmentation singularity may be subtracted from the direct cross section and replaced by a single-photon \u201cone-fragmentation\u201d contribution g +g \u2014 (q frag y) +7, where \u201c(q frag 7)\u201d denotes collinear production of one hard photon from a quark, described by a function D,(z, (1) at a light- cone momentum fraction z and factorization scale ju.
