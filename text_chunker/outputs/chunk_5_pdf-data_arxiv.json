It is applicable for values of diphoton transverse momentum that are less than the diphoton mass, i.e., for Qr < Q. When Qr ~ Q, terms of the form In\"(Q7r/Q) become small. A perturbative expansion with a single hard scale is then applicable, and the cross section can be obtained from finite-order perturbation theory. In addition to the initial-state logarithmic singularities, there is a set of important final- state singularities which arise in the matrix elements when at least one photon\u2019s momentum is collinear to the momentum of a final-state parton. They are sometimes referred to as \u2018fragmentation\u2019 singularities. At lowest order in az, the final-state singularity appears only in the gg > yyq diagrams, as in Fig. [I] (e). There are various methods used in the literature to deal with the final-state singularity, including the introduction of explicit fragmentation functions D,(z) for hard photon production, where z is the light-cone fraction of the interme- diate parton\u2019s momentum carried by the photon. These single-photon \u201cone-fragmentation\u201d and \u201ctwo-fragm"
