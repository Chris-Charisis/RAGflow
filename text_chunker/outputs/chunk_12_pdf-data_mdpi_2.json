        "abstract": "Fluorescent labels, commonly used in highly sensitive analytical techniques for detecting and tracking biomolecules in critical fields like cellular biology, medicine, medicinal chemistry, and environmental science, are currently too expensive for routine use in standard applications, with most exhibiting small Stokes shifts. This limitation underscores the potential of 4-diethylaminobenzaldehyde derivatives as a cost-effective alternative for developing new, bright fluorophores with larger Stokes shifts. In this work, using 4-diethylaminobenzaldehyde as starting material, we developed a simple, cost-effective, and efficient synthetic strategy to produce new affordable small molecules as effective fluorescent labels for biomolecules. Density functional theory and time-dependent density functional theory calculations were also conducted to gain insights into the observed photophysical properties.",

The strongest absorption band, in the region of 390\u2013690 nm, is produced from the delocalized \u03c0\u2014\u03c0* transition of aromatic moieties present in the 4-styryl-N,N-diethylaniline derivatives. The less extensive conjugated system in derivative 7, compared to derivatives 4 and 10, results in a higher energy gap between the ground and the excited states, leading to absorption at shorter wavelengths. An illustrative depiction of the charge rearrangement occurring during the S0\u2192S1 transitions is provided in Figure S1. The figure shows the difference in electronic densities between the states involved in the transition, clearly indicating the regions of the chromophore that lose or gain electronic charge upon excitation. It is very clear that for compounds 7 and 10 there are large re- arrangements of charge density with a clear decrease and increase in density in distinct regions of the molecule, thereby allowing the transition to be classified as intramolecular Transitions with a high \u2206r index reflect a strong ICT character, typically classified as such when exceeding the widely accepted threshold of 2.0 \u00c5. Following this criterion, all the S1 excitations "
