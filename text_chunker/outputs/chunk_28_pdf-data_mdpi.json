        "abstract": "Mushrooms contain valuable nutrients, proteins, minerals, and vitamins, and it is suggested to include them in our diet. Many farmers grow mushrooms in restricted environments with specific atmospheric parameters in greenhouses. In addition, recent technologies of the Internet of things intend to give solutions in the agriculture area. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of machine learning for mushroom growth monitoring for the genus Pleurotus. We use YOLOv5 to detect mushrooms' growing stage and indicate those ready to harvest. The results show that it can detect mushrooms in the greenhouse with an F1-score of up to 76.5%. The classification in the final stage of mushroom growth gives an accuracy of up to 70%, which is acceptable considering the complexity of the photos used. In addition, we propose a method for mushroom growth monitoring based on Detectron2. Our method shows that the average growth period of the mushrooms is 5.22 days. Moreover, our method is also adequate to indicate the harvesting day. The evaluation results show that it could improve the time to harvest for 14.04% of the mushrooms.",

Moreover, a proposed methodology to overcome these obstacles could be to exclude mushrooms that are partially displayed in the picture and to focus only on those clearly displayed. Furthermore, the 600 steps we used for the hyperparameter evolution in this research may not be good enough, and more steps will result in a better detection accuracy. This would lead to better combinations of the hyperparameters, but the hyperparameter evolu- tion procedure is a very time-consuming task, even for a professional graphic processing unit. A better approach to enhance the model\u2019s accuracy is to modify the YOLOv5 algorithm. Thus, the trained model would include the speci\ufb01c characteristics of the different classes. Our second approach for mushroom growth monitoring could also be helpful for a decision support system to inform farmers about the harvesting time. As a result, an improvement in product quality is expected since mushrooms will be collected at the right time. Furthermore, the precisely detected mask of the mushrooms may support other potential applications. For example, it could be a useful part of a robotic mechanism in order to dete"
