        "abstract": "Fluorescent labels, commonly used in highly sensitive analytical techniques for detecting and tracking biomolecules in critical fields like cellular biology, medicine, medicinal chemistry, and environmental science, are currently too expensive for routine use in standard applications, with most exhibiting small Stokes shifts. This limitation underscores the potential of 4-diethylaminobenzaldehyde derivatives as a cost-effective alternative for developing new, bright fluorophores with larger Stokes shifts. In this work, using 4-diethylaminobenzaldehyde as starting material, we developed a simple, cost-effective, and efficient synthetic strategy to produce new affordable small molecules as effective fluorescent labels for biomolecules. Density functional theory and time-dependent density functional theory calculations were also conducted to gain insights into the observed photophysical properties.",

        "text": " efficiency observed in the synthesized probes derived from the fluorescent markers containing derivative 10 may be due to the low value of its fluorescence quantum yield. Considering that FISH is a crucial cytoge- netic technique widely used in genomic and cell biological research, as well as in diagnostic applications in preventive and reproductive medicine and oncology, these new affordable and effective fluorescent labels hold significant potential for routine use in these fields. Beyond the FISH technique, these findings provide groundwork for exploring a wide range of potential applications for these promising new amino-reactive fluorescent labels. The use of the DFT and TD-DFT calculations provided valuable insights into the observed photophysical proper- ties, particularly the intramolecular charge transfer and large Stokes shifts. These shifts were attributed to the significant structural relaxation of the molecules in the excited states, offering a rational explanation for the phenomenon.
