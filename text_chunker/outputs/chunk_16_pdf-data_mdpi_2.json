        "abstract": "Fluorescent labels, commonly used in highly sensitive analytical techniques for detecting and tracking biomolecules in critical fields like cellular biology, medicine, medicinal chemistry, and environmental science, are currently too expensive for routine use in standard applications, with most exhibiting small Stokes shifts. This limitation underscores the potential of 4-diethylaminobenzaldehyde derivatives as a cost-effective alternative for developing new, bright fluorophores with larger Stokes shifts. In this work, using 4-diethylaminobenzaldehyde as starting material, we developed a simple, cost-effective, and efficient synthetic strategy to produce new affordable small molecules as effective fluorescent labels for biomolecules. Density functional theory and time-dependent density functional theory calculations were also conducted to gain insights into the observed photophysical properties.",

        "text": "ative 4 can be explained by the slight variations in the geometries between the excited state S1 and the ground state S0. As a result, the HOMO\u2013LUMO energy gap experiences a smaller decrease compared to the other derivatives. Notably, compound 4 exhibits a rotation of 2.9\u25e6, maintaining a distinctly non-planar structure in the S1 excited state, while compound 10 approaches a nearly planar configuration. In contrast, compound 7 retains an almost planar conformation but undergoes a considerable decrease in BLA values, resulting in a smaller energy gap. Based on the geometry optimization of the lowest excited state S1, the theoretical fluorescence lifetime of the excited states can be determined using Einstein\u2019s equation for the transition probabilities of spontaneous emissions. Here, \u03c4 represents the fluorescence lifetime, c is the speed of light in a vacuum, E denotes the transition energy, and f corresponds to the oscillator strength for the S1\u2192S0 transition. The calculated fluorescence lifetimes for the dyes are presented in Table S3. For all dyes examined, the values are significantly shorter than 10 ns, which is typical for emissive states of organic fluorophores, whereas longer "
