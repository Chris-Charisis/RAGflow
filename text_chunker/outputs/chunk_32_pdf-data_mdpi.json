        "abstract": "Mushrooms contain valuable nutrients, proteins, minerals, and vitamins, and it is suggested to include them in our diet. Many farmers grow mushrooms in restricted environments with specific atmospheric parameters in greenhouses. In addition, recent technologies of the Internet of things intend to give solutions in the agriculture area. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of machine learning for mushroom growth monitoring for the genus Pleurotus. We use YOLOv5 to detect mushrooms' growing stage and indicate those ready to harvest. The results show that it can detect mushrooms in the greenhouse with an F1-score of up to 76.5%. The classification in the final stage of mushroom growth gives an accuracy of up to 70%, which is acceptable considering the complexity of the photos used. In addition, we propose a method for mushroom growth monitoring based on Detectron2. Our method shows that the average growth period of the mushrooms is 5.22 days. Moreover, our method is also adequate to indicate the harvesting day. The evaluation results show that it could improve the time to harvest for 14.04% of the mushrooms.",

Moreover, this procedure made it possible to detect when mushrooms reached their maximum size and were ready to harvest. The evaluation results showed that it was possible to make de- cisions and improve harvesting time for up to 14.04% of the mushrooms in the greenhouse. In addition, the results showed that, on average, Pleurotus mushrooms needed 5.22 days to reach maximum size. Moreover, the proposed methods are suitable to be part of a decision support system to inform farmers about the status of their cultivation. In addition, a future potential application would be a robotic mechanism able to detect and recognise the growth stage of mushrooms before harvesting them.
