        "abstract": "Fluorescent labels, commonly used in highly sensitive analytical techniques for detecting and tracking biomolecules in critical fields like cellular biology, medicine, medicinal chemistry, and environmental science, are currently too expensive for routine use in standard applications, with most exhibiting small Stokes shifts. This limitation underscores the potential of 4-diethylaminobenzaldehyde derivatives as a cost-effective alternative for developing new, bright fluorophores with larger Stokes shifts. In this work, using 4-diethylaminobenzaldehyde as starting material, we developed a simple, cost-effective, and efficient synthetic strategy to produce new affordable small molecules as effective fluorescent labels for biomolecules. Density functional theory and time-dependent density functional theory calculations were also conducted to gain insights into the observed photophysical properties.",

        "text": "he studied compounds (Figure 1 and Table S1). For all the compounds, both the HOMO and LUMO orbitals display minimal involvement around the attached reactive group, suggesting that this group does not participate in the \u03c0-conjugation system and remains uninvolved in the excitation process. This is a valuable aspect for maintaining the dye\u2019s fluorescence properties when attached to a biomolecule. Focusing on the HOMO states, the prominent characteristic observed is that these orbitals exhibit greater localization in the 4-styryl-N,N-diethylaniline moiety for the three compounds while the LUMO orbitals spread over the indole, pyridine, and quinoline groups. This is more pronounced for compound 10 and less noticeable for compound 4. A thorough definition of the excitation type can be achieved by analyzing the orbitals involved or the electronic density difference that occurs upon excitation. The S0 \u2192 S1 tran- sition can be attributed to \u03c0\u2192\u03c0* electron transitions and is primarily of HOMO\u2192LUMO character for all the compounds. The strongest absorption band, in the region of 390\u2013690 nm, is produced from the delocalized \u03c0\u2014\u03c0* transition of aromatic moieties present in the 4-styryl-N,N-dieth"
