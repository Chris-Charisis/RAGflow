The choice Cy = 1 implies that we equate the renormalization and factorization scales to the invariant mass of the photon pair, 4p = yr = Q, in the fixed- order and asymptotic contributions P(Q, Qr,y,Q.) and A(Q, Qr,y, 2.4). We use two-loop expressions for the running electromagnetic and strong couplings a(j:) and ag(j), as well as the NLO parton distribution function set CTEQ6M with Qing = 1.3 GeV. For calculations with explicit final-state fragmentation functions included, we use set 1 of the NLO photon fragmentation functions from Ref. . In this setion, we present our results for the Tevatron p\u00afp ollider operating at \u221aS = 1.96 TeV. In order to ompare with the data from the Collider Detetor at Fermilab (CDF) We impose isolation conditions described in Section assuming the nominal isolation energy Ei8? = 1 GeV specified in the CDF publication, along with AR = 0.4, and AR,, = 0.3. used by the Fermilab D\u00d8 Collaboration [35\u2104: p\u03b3 T > p\u03b3 T min = 21 (20) GeV for the harder T /E\u03b3 < 1.1, and Eiso y\u03b3 T = 0.07 for eah photon, for th"
