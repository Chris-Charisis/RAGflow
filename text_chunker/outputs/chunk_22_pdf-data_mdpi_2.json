        "abstract": "Fluorescent labels, commonly used in highly sensitive analytical techniques for detecting and tracking biomolecules in critical fields like cellular biology, medicine, medicinal chemistry, and environmental science, are currently too expensive for routine use in standard applications, with most exhibiting small Stokes shifts. This limitation underscores the potential of 4-diethylaminobenzaldehyde derivatives as a cost-effective alternative for developing new, bright fluorophores with larger Stokes shifts. In this work, using 4-diethylaminobenzaldehyde as starting material, we developed a simple, cost-effective, and efficient synthetic strategy to produce new affordable small molecules as effective fluorescent labels for biomolecules. Density functional theory and time-dependent density functional theory calculations were also conducted to gain insights into the observed photophysical properties.",

When Bacillus sp. cells were hybridized with the synthesized oligonu- cleotide probe EUB338-(4), there was a statistically significant increase in the percentage of fluorescent cells (p < 0.05) compared to the control cells hybridized with the synthesized oligonucleotide probes EUB338-(7) and EUB338-(10). The EUB338-(4) probe shows statis- tically identical values for the percentage of fluorescent cells to the cells hybridized with the commercial probe EUB338-Cy3. On the other hand, cells labeled with the EUB338-(10) probe showed a low percentage of fluorescent cells, less than 20%. This result indicates that the EUB338-(10) probe has low specificity for labeling prokaryotic cells. Once again, the epifluorescence microscopy observations validate the results obtained by flow cytometry, since the oligonucleotide probes EUB338-Cy3, EUB338-(4), and EUB338-(7) (Figure S5A,C,E) show higher fluorescence intensities. Conversely, in the case of the hybridization tests of Bacillus cells with the probes EUK516-Cy3, EUK516-(4), EUK516-(7), and EUK516-(10), no fluorescence signal was detected, as anticipated (Figure S5B,D,F,H). These findings further confirm th"
