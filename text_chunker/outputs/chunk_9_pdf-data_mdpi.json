        "abstract": "Mushrooms contain valuable nutrients, proteins, minerals, and vitamins, and it is suggested to include them in our diet. Many farmers grow mushrooms in restricted environments with specific atmospheric parameters in greenhouses. In addition, recent technologies of the Internet of things intend to give solutions in the agriculture area. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of machine learning for mushroom growth monitoring for the genus Pleurotus. We use YOLOv5 to detect mushrooms' growing stage and indicate those ready to harvest. The results show that it can detect mushrooms in the greenhouse with an F1-score of up to 76.5%. The classification in the final stage of mushroom growth gives an accuracy of up to 70%, which is acceptable considering the complexity of the photos used. In addition, we propose a method for mushroom growth monitoring based on Detectron2. Our method shows that the average growth period of the mushrooms is 5.22 days. Moreover, our method is also adequate to indicate the harvesting day. The evaluation results show that it could improve the time to harvest for 14.04% of the mushrooms.",

        "text": " The evaluation results showed an accuracy of mushroom recognition of up to 95.0% and a harvesting success rate of up to 86.8%. The average harvesting time for a single mushroom was 8.85 s. The authors in [19] provided a measurement monitoring system to observe mushroom growth in a greenhouse. The proposed system used YOLOv3 for mushroom detection and an additional localisation method to improve the position of the detected mushroom in order to distinguish the same mushroom in different captured photos. Moreover, the system was able to estimate the harvesting time. In [16], the authors presented a mushroom farm automation to classify toxic mush- rooms. The proposed system adopted machine learning to distinguish edible mushrooms from poisonous mushrooms. The utilised model was a combination of six different clas- si\ufb01ers that worked together and reach an accuracy of 100%. More speci\ufb01cally, the en- semble model used the following classi\ufb01ers: decision tree (DT), logistic regression (LR), K-nearest neighbours (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), naive Bayes (NB), and ran- dom forest (RF). Moreover, the manuscript introduced an architectural design for smart mushroom farming. The authors"
