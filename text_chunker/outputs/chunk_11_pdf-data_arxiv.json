[] (b)-(e), (i)-(1) and denoted as P(Q, Qr,y, 2x), are computed in Refs. (3, Bid ran Ch NLO 2 > 3 differen- tial cross section grows logarithmically if i i Ie state. parton is soft or collinear to the initial-state quark or gluon, i.e., when Qr of the yy pair is much smaller than Q. These \u201cinitial-state\u201d logarithmic contributions are summed to all orders later in this subsection. The NLO qg cross section also contains a large logarithm when one of the photons is pro- duced from a collinear \u2018q\u2019 3 Vy splitting in the final state. This \u201cfinal-state\u201d collinear limit is discussed in Section [ILC] in the gg+gqgs scattering channel. The functions F.,5(Q, y, 0.) and FO.
