An infrared-safe procedure can be formulated to apply isolation cuts at each order of As (22, 23, [a4}. This procedure encounters difficulties in reproducing the effects of isolation on fragmentation contributions, because theoretical models reflect only basic features of the experimental isolation and may introduce new logarithmic singularities near the edges of the isolation cones. As mentioned in the Introduction, the magnitude of the fragmentation contribution de- e"
