        "abstract": "Fluorescent labels, commonly used in highly sensitive analytical techniques for detecting and tracking biomolecules in critical fields like cellular biology, medicine, medicinal chemistry, and environmental science, are currently too expensive for routine use in standard applications, with most exhibiting small Stokes shifts. This limitation underscores the potential of 4-diethylaminobenzaldehyde derivatives as a cost-effective alternative for developing new, bright fluorophores with larger Stokes shifts. In this work, using 4-diethylaminobenzaldehyde as starting material, we developed a simple, cost-effective, and efficient synthetic strategy to produce new affordable small molecules as effective fluorescent labels for biomolecules. Density functional theory and time-dependent density functional theory calculations were also conducted to gain insights into the observed photophysical properties.",

        "text": "he possible elimination of the spectral overlap between absorption and emission, in fluorophores with large Stokes shifts, allows us to eliminate the quenching process and reduce interference, providing the effective detection of the fluorescence emission. As expected, the 4-styryl-N,N-diethylaniline derivatives 4, 7, and 10 exhibit absorption maxima at significantly longer wavelengths compared to 4-diethylaminobenzaldehyde (1). This is attributed to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect resulting from the conjugation of the electron-donating NEt2 group and the styryl group at position 4, which is also conjugated with the electron-withdrawing groups. The most intense absorption band, occurring in the range of 390\u2013690 nm, is likely due to the delocalized \u03c0\u2192\u03c0* transition of the aromatic moieties present in the 4-styryl-N,N- diethylaniline derivatives. The shorter or less extensive conjugated system in derivative 7, compared to the systems in derivatives 4 and 10, can create a higher energy gap between the ground and excited states, resulting in absorption at shorter wavelengths. The molar coefficients and the fluorescence quantum yields were strongly affected, both in the s"
