        "text": " in the yy invariant mass Q, the transverse momentum Qr, and the azimuthal angle separation Ay in the lab rame are shown in Fig. For the cuts chosen, the LO gg and the resummed gg+ gqg total rates constitute about 9% and 20% of the total rate. The resummed and DIPHOX invariant mass distributions (Fig. [[3{a)) are brought closer to one another as a result of the inclusion of the gg + gqs contribution in the resummed calculation. For Qr \u00a5 0, the full DIPHOX Qr distribution in Fig. [I3{b) is determined entirely by direct plus fragmentation contributions (the same as in Fig. [12(a)), because the LO gg cross section contributes at Qr = 0 only. In contrast, our resummed gg + gqs contribution modifies the event rate at all Qr. The resummed and DIPHOX rates are in a reasonable agreement for 1.5 < Ay < 2.5, as shown in Fig. [13(c). In the Ay \u2014 7 limit, the fixed-order rates in DIPHOX diverge because of the singularities at small Q7, while our resummed rate yields a finite value. For Ay < 1.5, the DIPHOX cross section is enhanced by photon fragmentation contributions. As at the energy of the Tevatron, theoretical uncertainties are greater at small Ay. Predictions are most reliable when Qr < "
