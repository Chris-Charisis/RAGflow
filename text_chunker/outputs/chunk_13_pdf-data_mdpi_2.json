        "abstract": "Fluorescent labels, commonly used in highly sensitive analytical techniques for detecting and tracking biomolecules in critical fields like cellular biology, medicine, medicinal chemistry, and environmental science, are currently too expensive for routine use in standard applications, with most exhibiting small Stokes shifts. This limitation underscores the potential of 4-diethylaminobenzaldehyde derivatives as a cost-effective alternative for developing new, bright fluorophores with larger Stokes shifts. In this work, using 4-diethylaminobenzaldehyde as starting material, we developed a simple, cost-effective, and efficient synthetic strategy to produce new affordable small molecules as effective fluorescent labels for biomolecules. Density functional theory and time-dependent density functional theory calculations were also conducted to gain insights into the observed photophysical properties.",

        "text": "r Transitions with a high \u2206r index reflect a strong ICT character, typically classified as such when exceeding the widely accepted threshold of 2.0 \u00c5. Following this criterion, all the S1 excitations can be classified as ICT. However, the index value is much larger, indicating a much larger distance displacement of the charge upon excitation for compounds 7 and 10, while for compound 4, it is at the ICT classification limit. Another parameter employed to characterize the nature of electronic transitions is the lambda index \u039b, which is a measure of the overlap between the hole and electron states during electronic excitations. Notably, the \u039b indices are almost inversely proportional to the \u2206r indices, since a greater hole\u2013electron overlap generally indicates a shorter separation distance between them. Following the trend of the \u2206r observed value, the \u039b values are significantly smaller for compounds 7 and 10 compared to compound 4. The molecular configurations of the 4-styryl-N,N-diethylaniline derivatives in their ground state are depicted in Figure S1. In their ground state, deviations from planarity (~19.4\u25e6 and 8.1\u25e6) are observed in derivatives 4 and 10, respectively, namely betwe"
