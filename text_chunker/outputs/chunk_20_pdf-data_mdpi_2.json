        "abstract": "Fluorescent labels, commonly used in highly sensitive analytical techniques for detecting and tracking biomolecules in critical fields like cellular biology, medicine, medicinal chemistry, and environmental science, are currently too expensive for routine use in standard applications, with most exhibiting small Stokes shifts. This limitation underscores the potential of 4-diethylaminobenzaldehyde derivatives as a cost-effective alternative for developing new, bright fluorophores with larger Stokes shifts. In this work, using 4-diethylaminobenzaldehyde as starting material, we developed a simple, cost-effective, and efficient synthetic strategy to produce new affordable small molecules as effective fluorescent labels for biomolecules. Density functional theory and time-dependent density functional theory calculations were also conducted to gain insights into the observed photophysical properties.",

This result once again reinforces the lack of specificity of these probes for eukaryotic cells (Figure 2). Epifluorescence microscopy confirms the results obtained by flow cytometry, highlighting that the oligonucleotide probes EUK516-Cy3, EUK516-(4), and EUK516-(7) shown in Figure S3A,C,E, show more intense signals. Regard- ing the results of the hybridization tests of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells with the EUB338 The flow cytometry results demonstrating the hybridization of Bacillus sp. (BA) cells with both commercial and synthesized oligonucleotide probes are shown in Figure S4. Bacterial cells exhibit more intense fluorescence than autofluorescence when labeled with the EUB338 oligonucleotide probes, since these probes target the rRNA region of prokary- otic cells (Figure S4A,C,E,G). Cells hybridized with the EUB338-Cy3 probe emitted a higher fluorescence intensity than the autofluorescence of unlabeled bacterial cells (BA) (Figure S4A). This fluorescence indicates that the EUB338-Cy3 probe has high hybridization rates. In contrast, cells hybridized with the EUK516-Cy3 probe exhibited f"
