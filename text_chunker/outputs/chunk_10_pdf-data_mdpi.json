        "abstract": "Mushrooms contain valuable nutrients, proteins, minerals, and vitamins, and it is suggested to include them in our diet. Many farmers grow mushrooms in restricted environments with specific atmospheric parameters in greenhouses. In addition, recent technologies of the Internet of things intend to give solutions in the agriculture area. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of machine learning for mushroom growth monitoring for the genus Pleurotus. We use YOLOv5 to detect mushrooms' growing stage and indicate those ready to harvest. The results show that it can detect mushrooms in the greenhouse with an F1-score of up to 76.5%. The classification in the final stage of mushroom growth gives an accuracy of up to 70%, which is acceptable considering the complexity of the photos used. In addition, we propose a method for mushroom growth monitoring based on Detectron2. Our method shows that the average growth period of the mushrooms is 5.22 days. Moreover, our method is also adequate to indicate the harvesting day. The evaluation results show that it could improve the time to harvest for 14.04% of the mushrooms.",

Moreover, the manuscript introduced an architectural design for smart mushroom farming. The authors in [29] presented an automatic sorting system for fresh, white button mushrooms. Apart from the automatic mechanism, they proposed an image processing algorithm to collect button mushrooms. The algorithm eliminated the shadow and petiole on the image and determined the pileus diameter of the mushrooms. Experimental results showed that compared to manual grading speed, their approach was improved by 38.86%, and the accuracy was improved by 6.84%. ===background=== In this section, we brie\ufb02y presenting the main characteristics of YOLOv5 [25] and Detectron2 [23]. Both of them are suitable for object detection in images or videos. Moreover, they both belong to object detection algorithms based on convolutional neural networks. Thus, they return the class and the position of the detected object. Furthermore, Detectron2 is also an instance segmentation algorithm able to return a corresponding mask that de\ufb01nes the area of the object.
