        "abstract": "Fluorescent labels, commonly used in highly sensitive analytical techniques for detecting and tracking biomolecules in critical fields like cellular biology, medicine, medicinal chemistry, and environmental science, are currently too expensive for routine use in standard applications, with most exhibiting small Stokes shifts. This limitation underscores the potential of 4-diethylaminobenzaldehyde derivatives as a cost-effective alternative for developing new, bright fluorophores with larger Stokes shifts. In this work, using 4-diethylaminobenzaldehyde as starting material, we developed a simple, cost-effective, and efficient synthetic strategy to produce new affordable small molecules as effective fluorescent labels for biomolecules. Density functional theory and time-dependent density functional theory calculations were also conducted to gain insights into the observed photophysical properties.",

En- hanced push\u2013pull electronic effects in this kind of molecules, whose excitation involves intramolecular charge transfer (ICT), lead to a bathochromic (red) shift in both their UV-vis absorption and emission spectra [18\u201320]. Amine-reactive fluorescent labels are extensively utilized in various biological applications owing to their affinity for amino groups and their facile incorporation into biomolecules [21]. These fluorescent labels are indispensable in various modern scientific applications, including fluorescence microscopy, histochemistry, flow cytometry, cell tracing, receptor binding studies, direct and indirect immunochemistry, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) [22\u201324]. At present, the fluorescent labels are prohibitively expensive for regular use in routine applications and most of them have small Stokes shifts, less than 30 nm, such as fluorescein, rhodamine, oxazine, and cyanine. This limitation highlights the potential for 4-diethylaminobenzaldehyde derivatives to offer a cost-effective alternative for the development of new bright fluorophores with large Stokes shifts [25,26].
