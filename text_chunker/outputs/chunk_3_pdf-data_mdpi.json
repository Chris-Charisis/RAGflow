        "abstract": "Mushrooms contain valuable nutrients, proteins, minerals, and vitamins, and it is suggested to include them in our diet. Many farmers grow mushrooms in restricted environments with specific atmospheric parameters in greenhouses. In addition, recent technologies of the Internet of things intend to give solutions in the agriculture area. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of machine learning for mushroom growth monitoring for the genus Pleurotus. We use YOLOv5 to detect mushrooms' growing stage and indicate those ready to harvest. The results show that it can detect mushrooms in the greenhouse with an F1-score of up to 76.5%. The classification in the final stage of mushroom growth gives an accuracy of up to 70%, which is acceptable considering the complexity of the photos used. In addition, we propose a method for mushroom growth monitoring based on Detectron2. Our method shows that the average growth period of the mushrooms is 5.22 days. Moreover, our method is also adequate to indicate the harvesting day. The evaluation results show that it could improve the time to harvest for 14.04% of the mushrooms.",

        "text": " detection of fruits with machine learning is also valuable in robotic mechanisms [7\u20139]. Disease detection has already seen numerous research efforts evaluating the ability to detect various diseases in various crops [10\u201312]. Moreover, insect detection is another important task in cultivation. Thus, many research efforts exist in this area [13,14]. Furthermore, machine learning is already used in research efforts in mushroom culti- vation or wild mushroom hunting, aiming to give solutions to various tasks. The authors in [15] gave a comprehensive review in this area. One of the main tasks based on machine learning focuses on species recognition. For example, the authors in [16] provided a method to distinguish edible mushrooms from poisonous ones. In addition, the authors in [17] suggested a method for species recognition with a mobile smart device. Another research effort on mushroom species classi\ufb01cation is presented in [18]. Furthermore, a few research efforts have used object detection algorithms in order to localise and classify mushrooms in a photo. The authors in [19] developed a system that used object detection to localise and recognise mushrooms that were ready to harvest"
