        "abstract": "Fluorescent labels, commonly used in highly sensitive analytical techniques for detecting and tracking biomolecules in critical fields like cellular biology, medicine, medicinal chemistry, and environmental science, are currently too expensive for routine use in standard applications, with most exhibiting small Stokes shifts. This limitation underscores the potential of 4-diethylaminobenzaldehyde derivatives as a cost-effective alternative for developing new, bright fluorophores with larger Stokes shifts. In this work, using 4-diethylaminobenzaldehyde as starting material, we developed a simple, cost-effective, and efficient synthetic strategy to produce new affordable small molecules as effective fluorescent labels for biomolecules. Density functional theory and time-dependent density functional theory calculations were also conducted to gain insights into the observed photophysical properties.",

The RNA-FISH methodology involves several preparatory steps, including: (i) fixation of sample cells, (ii) permeabilization of cells, (iii) hybridization with specific probes to target the desired sequences, (iv) washing to eliminate unbound probes, and (v) detection and quantification of signals [36]. The two following microorganisms were chosen as biological models: (i) the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and (ii) the bacteria Bacillus sp., both sourced from the culture collection of the Laboratory of Biodegradation and Biotechnology at the HERCULES Laboratory, University of \u00c9vora. Bacterial and yeast cells were initially cultivated for 2 days at 30 \u25e6C on nutrient agar (composed of 5.0 g/L peptone, 3.0 g/L beef extract powder, and 15.0 g/L agar, pH 7.4) and YPD-agar (composed of 20.0 g/L glucose, 20.0 g/L peptone, 10.0 g/L yeast extract, and 20.0 g/L agar, pH 6.0) slants, respectively. They were then stored at 4.0 \u25e6C. To prepare the inocula, cells were harvested from the fresh surfaces of the slants using 2.0 mL of physiological saline solution. Subsequently, 250 mL Erlenmeyer flasks containing 100 mL of nutrient broth (NB) and YPD were inoculated an"
