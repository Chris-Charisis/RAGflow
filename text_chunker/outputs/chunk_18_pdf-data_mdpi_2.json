        "abstract": "Fluorescent labels, commonly used in highly sensitive analytical techniques for detecting and tracking biomolecules in critical fields like cellular biology, medicine, medicinal chemistry, and environmental science, are currently too expensive for routine use in standard applications, with most exhibiting small Stokes shifts. This limitation underscores the potential of 4-diethylaminobenzaldehyde derivatives as a cost-effective alternative for developing new, bright fluorophores with larger Stokes shifts. In this work, using 4-diethylaminobenzaldehyde as starting material, we developed a simple, cost-effective, and efficient synthetic strategy to produce new affordable small molecules as effective fluorescent labels for biomolecules. Density functional theory and time-dependent density functional theory calculations were also conducted to gain insights into the observed photophysical properties.",

In contrast, cells treated with the EUB338-Cy3 probe emitted fluorescence signals comparable to the autofluorescence observed in unlabeled cells as anticipated, indicating a lack of hybridization (Figure S2B). Therefore, this probe adequately performs its function as a negative control in experiments involving eukaryotic cells, validating that, under the experimental conditions, cellular autofluorescence enables specific and reliable detection. In the case of cells hybridized with the EUK516 probes with the synthesized fluorescent labels, only the cells labelled with the EUK516-(4) and EUK516-(7) probes show fluorescence signals (Figure S2C,E), indicating that these probes have a higher hybridization rate than the EUK516-(10) probe (Figure S2G). This probe shows unpromising results, as it shows similar fluorescence intensities to the negative control (EUB338-(10)) and to yeast autofluorescence (SC). In contrast, the cells hy- bridized with the EUB338-(4), EUB338-(7), and EUB338-(10) probes exhibited fluorescence signals identical to the autofluorescence of the ye"
