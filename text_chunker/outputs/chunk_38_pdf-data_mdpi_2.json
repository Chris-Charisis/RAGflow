        "abstract": "Fluorescent labels, commonly used in highly sensitive analytical techniques for detecting and tracking biomolecules in critical fields like cellular biology, medicine, medicinal chemistry, and environmental science, are currently too expensive for routine use in standard applications, with most exhibiting small Stokes shifts. This limitation underscores the potential of 4-diethylaminobenzaldehyde derivatives as a cost-effective alternative for developing new, bright fluorophores with larger Stokes shifts. In this work, using 4-diethylaminobenzaldehyde as starting material, we developed a simple, cost-effective, and efficient synthetic strategy to produce new affordable small molecules as effective fluorescent labels for biomolecules. Density functional theory and time-dependent density functional theory calculations were also conducted to gain insights into the observed photophysical properties.",

To interpret the observed photo- physical properties, density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations were carried out using the Gaussian 16 software package [31]. The hybrid meta-GGA functional M062X [32] and the standard 6-31G(d,p) basis set were employed for optimizing the geometries of the ground state. The excited state geometries were optimized using TD-DFT with the same functional and basis set. Solvent effects were incorporated through the implicit polarized continuum model (PCM) [33,34]. Vibrational analysis showed no imaginary frequencies, confirming that the structures represent the true minima. In the TD-DFT spectral calculations, the triple-zeta 6-311+G(d,p) basis set was employed. targeting the rRNA regions of eukaryotic (yeast) cells, and EUB338-mod (5\u2032-GCTGCCTCCC GTAGGAGT-3\u2032), targeting the rRNA regions of prokaryotic (bacterial) cells, were sourced from Eurofins Scientific (Luxembourg City, Luxembourg) and STAB Vida (Caparica, Portu- gal). The required amount of N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (NHS) was"
