        "abstract": "Mushrooms contain valuable nutrients, proteins, minerals, and vitamins, and it is suggested to include them in our diet. Many farmers grow mushrooms in restricted environments with specific atmospheric parameters in greenhouses. In addition, recent technologies of the Internet of things intend to give solutions in the agriculture area. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of machine learning for mushroom growth monitoring for the genus Pleurotus. We use YOLOv5 to detect mushrooms' growing stage and indicate those ready to harvest. The results show that it can detect mushrooms in the greenhouse with an F1-score of up to 76.5%. The classification in the final stage of mushroom growth gives an accuracy of up to 70%, which is acceptable considering the complexity of the photos used. In addition, we propose a method for mushroom growth monitoring based on Detectron2. Our method shows that the average growth period of the mushrooms is 5.22 days. Moreover, our method is also adequate to indicate the harvesting day. The evaluation results show that it could improve the time to harvest for 14.04% of the mushrooms.",

For example, it could be a useful part of a robotic mechanism in order to detect, decide, and collect only those mushrooms that are ready to harvest without damaging them. The method of mushroom growth monitoring with Detectron2 also has some limi- tations. Our method focused only on mushrooms that were on top of the substrate bag, which was placed horizontally in the greenhouse. In fact, only one-third of the mushrooms could be observed with this method since there were also substrate bags positioned verti- cally below the substrate bag we used. In addition, in many cases, the substrate bags are densely placed in the greenhouse, and sometimes, the farmers use more than one layer of substrate grow bags in the greenhouse, making it dif\ufb01cult to capture photos even from those positioned horizontally. Furthermore, getting only one image per day has the disadvantage that the growing days may not be counted precisely in some mushrooms. For example, some mushrooms may appear a few hours after a picture was taken, resulting in a day count less than the actual growth dur"
