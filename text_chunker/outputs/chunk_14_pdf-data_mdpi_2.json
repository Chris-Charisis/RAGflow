        "abstract": "Fluorescent labels, commonly used in highly sensitive analytical techniques for detecting and tracking biomolecules in critical fields like cellular biology, medicine, medicinal chemistry, and environmental science, are currently too expensive for routine use in standard applications, with most exhibiting small Stokes shifts. This limitation underscores the potential of 4-diethylaminobenzaldehyde derivatives as a cost-effective alternative for developing new, bright fluorophores with larger Stokes shifts. In this work, using 4-diethylaminobenzaldehyde as starting material, we developed a simple, cost-effective, and efficient synthetic strategy to produce new affordable small molecules as effective fluorescent labels for biomolecules. Density functional theory and time-dependent density functional theory calculations were also conducted to gain insights into the observed photophysical properties.",

        "text": "aniline derivatives in their ground state are depicted in Figure S1. In their ground state, deviations from planarity (~19.4\u25e6 and 8.1\u25e6) are observed in derivatives 4 and 10, respectively, namely between the planes of the two rings, whereas compound 7 appear predominantly planar (Table S2). Upon entering the S1 electronic excited state, the overall structural arrangement of compound 7, already planar, remains relatively stable, with compound 4 undergoing a rotation of 2.9\u25e6 toward planarity and compound 10 becoming near planar. The transition from the S0 to the S1 state is marked by a significant decrease in bond length alternation (BLA) along the p bridge, signifying the average length difference between a single and adjacent double bond, which diminishes notably across all compounds. In the S0 state, BLA values range from 0.04 \u00c5 for compound 4 to 0.07 \u00c5 for compound 7. In contrast, in the excited state S1, the BLA undergoes a substantial reduction, reaching 0.00 \u00c5 for compound 4 and peaking at 0.02 \u00c5 for compound 10. The emission characteristics of the dyes, calculated from the optimized geometry of the S1 state, are presented in Table S1. The emission wavelengths for the S1\u2192S0 tra"
