        "abstract": "Mushrooms contain valuable nutrients, proteins, minerals, and vitamins, and it is suggested to include them in our diet. Many farmers grow mushrooms in restricted environments with specific atmospheric parameters in greenhouses. In addition, recent technologies of the Internet of things intend to give solutions in the agriculture area. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of machine learning for mushroom growth monitoring for the genus Pleurotus. We use YOLOv5 to detect mushrooms' growing stage and indicate those ready to harvest. The results show that it can detect mushrooms in the greenhouse with an F1-score of up to 76.5%. The classification in the final stage of mushroom growth gives an accuracy of up to 70%, which is acceptable considering the complexity of the photos used. In addition, we propose a method for mushroom growth monitoring based on Detectron2. Our method shows that the average growth period of the mushrooms is 5.22 days. Moreover, our method is also adequate to indicate the harvesting day. The evaluation results show that it could improve the time to harvest for 14.04% of the mushrooms.",

For mushroom growth monitoring, we used two different stages for the object detec- tion. The \ufb01rst one was responsible for detecting the substrate grow bag, and the second one was responsible for detecting the mushrooms in a photo. Figure 5 illustrates the main components of the architecture of the proposed method. More speci\ufb01cally, in the stage of the substrate grow bag detection, we use the trained model with Detectron2. We only obtained the bounding box of the detected substrate grow bag and not the mask. After the detection of the substrate grow bag, we used the corresponding bounding box and divided it into six equal rectangles (2 \u00d7 3). Figure 6a illustrates the bounding box (green) and the lines (red) that divide the bounding box in order to distinguish the detected mushrooms. Moreover, we used the trained model with Detectron2 to detect the mushrooms in the photo and return the corresponding masks. Figure 6b displays the detected mush- rooms. Next, we performed"
