        "abstract": "Fluorescent labels, commonly used in highly sensitive analytical techniques for detecting and tracking biomolecules in critical fields like cellular biology, medicine, medicinal chemistry, and environmental science, are currently too expensive for routine use in standard applications, with most exhibiting small Stokes shifts. This limitation underscores the potential of 4-diethylaminobenzaldehyde derivatives as a cost-effective alternative for developing new, bright fluorophores with larger Stokes shifts. In this work, using 4-diethylaminobenzaldehyde as starting material, we developed a simple, cost-effective, and efficient synthetic strategy to produce new affordable small molecules as effective fluorescent labels for biomolecules. Density functional theory and time-dependent density functional theory calculations were also conducted to gain insights into the observed photophysical properties.",

        "text": " lifetimes for the dyes are presented in Table S3. For all dyes examined, the values are significantly shorter than 10 ns, which is typical for emissive states of organic fluorophores, whereas longer radiative lifetimes are associated with nonradiative states. The results of the flow cytometry analysis of the hybridization of Saccharomyces cere- visiae (SC) cells with both commercial and synthesized oligonucleotide probes are presented in Figure S2. After a comprehensive analysis of these results, yeast cells labeled with EUK516 oligonucleotide probes demonstrate significantly higher fluorescence levels than the autofluorescence observed. This finding aligns with expectations, as these probes are designed to specifically target the rRNA region of eukaryotic cells (Figure S2A,C,E,G). Cells hybridized with the EUK516-Cy3 probe exhibit significantly higher fluorescence intensity compared to the autofluorescence of unlabeled Saccharomyces cerevisiae (SC) cells (Figure S2A). This fluorescence signal indicates the successful hybridization of the EUK516- Cy3 probe, demonstrating its effective binding capacity. In contrast, cells treated with the EUB338-Cy3 probe emitted fluorescence signa"
