        "text": "Qr is smaller than Q7\u201d, we calculate the event rate using the small- Qr asymptotic approximation A(Q, Qr, y, 2.) and 2 \u2014 2 phase space. Hence, the lowest bin of the Qr distribution is approximated in the NLO prediction by its average value in the interval 0 < Qr < Q7?, computed by integration of the asymptotic approximations. The phase-space slicing procedure is sufficient for predictions of observables inclusive in Qr, but not of the shape of do/dQr distributions. The latter goal is met by all-orders summa- tion of singular asymptotic contributions with the help of the Collins-Soper-Sterman (CSS) metho {it [16, . The small-Qr resummed cross section is denoted as W(Q, Qr, y, Qs) and given by a two-dimensional Fourier transform of a function W(Q, b, y, 2.) that depends on the impact parameter b: The \u201chard-vertex\u201d function \u00a5, (0. )hZ(Q, 6.) is the normalized cross section for the Born scat- tering aa > yy, with a = u,u,d,d,... in qq yy, and a=a=gq in gg > yy.
