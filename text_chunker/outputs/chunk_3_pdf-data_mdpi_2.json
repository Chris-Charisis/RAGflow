        "abstract": "Fluorescent labels, commonly used in highly sensitive analytical techniques for detecting and tracking biomolecules in critical fields like cellular biology, medicine, medicinal chemistry, and environmental science, are currently too expensive for routine use in standard applications, with most exhibiting small Stokes shifts. This limitation underscores the potential of 4-diethylaminobenzaldehyde derivatives as a cost-effective alternative for developing new, bright fluorophores with larger Stokes shifts. In this work, using 4-diethylaminobenzaldehyde as starting material, we developed a simple, cost-effective, and efficient synthetic strategy to produce new affordable small molecules as effective fluorescent labels for biomolecules. Density functional theory and time-dependent density functional theory calculations were also conducted to gain insights into the observed photophysical properties.",

Small fluorescent labels also offer significant practical benefits, enabling the optimization of fluorescence signals through the attachment of multiple fluorophores to a single biomolecule [14,15]. Typically, a donor-\u03c0 bridge-acceptor structure (D-\u03c0-A) serves as the fundamental structural framework respon- sible for imparting fluorescence to small organic molecules [16,17]. Advancements over recent decades have demonstrated that the arrangement and characteristics of substituents in a D-\u03c0-A structure, promote the delocalization of the conjugated \u03c0 electron system, producing derivatives with extraordinary photophysical and spectroscopic properties. En- hanced push\u2013pull electronic effects in this kind of molecules, whose excitation involves intramolecular charge transfer (ICT), lead to a bathochromic (red) shift in both their UV-vis abs"
