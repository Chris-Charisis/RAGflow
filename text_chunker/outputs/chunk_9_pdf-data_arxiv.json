        "text": " acceptance on distributions in the diphoton invariant mass. We compare our results with the DIPHOX calculation (14) and demonstrate that the requirement Qr < Q further suppresses the effects of the final-state fragmentation contribution, beyond the reduction associated with isolation. Next, we present our predictions for distributions of diphoton pairs produced at the energy of the LHC. Various distributions of the diphoton pairs produced from the decay of a Higgs boson are contrasted with those produced from QCD continuum processes at the LHC, showing that enhanced sensitivity to the signal can be obtained with judicious event selection. Our conclusions are presented in Sec.
