This distribution is displayed in the lower- left frame of Fig. The background distribution peaks at the origin, while the signal is almost flat over a wide range of Ay. Different spin correlations in the decay of a spin-0 Higgs boson from those characteristic of QCD background processes are the source of this distinction. Discrimination based on this difference can improve the statistical significance of the signal . We note that our resummed calculation does not exhibit the kinematic singularity at Ay ~ 2 present in the finite-order cross section and obvious in Fig. 10 of Ref. iid), where the distribution with respect to y* = Ay/2 is shown. The discontinuity in da /dQr caused by the finite-order approximation is resummed in our calculation, yielding a smooth result. A omparison of QT distributions in the top-left panel of Fig. 15 suggests that the signal versus bakground ratio would be enhaned if a ut is made to restrit QT > 10 GeV. QT , \u03d5\u2217, and cos\u03b8\u2217 distributions are good disriminators between the Higgs boson signal and The theoretial study of ontinuum diphoton prodution in hadron ollisions is interesting diphotons are a large standard-model bakgr"
