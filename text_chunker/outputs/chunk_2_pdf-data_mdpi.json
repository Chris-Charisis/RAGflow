        "abstract": "Mushrooms contain valuable nutrients, proteins, minerals, and vitamins, and it is suggested to include them in our diet. Many farmers grow mushrooms in restricted environments with specific atmospheric parameters in greenhouses. In addition, recent technologies of the Internet of things intend to give solutions in the agriculture area. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of machine learning for mushroom growth monitoring for the genus Pleurotus. We use YOLOv5 to detect mushrooms' growing stage and indicate those ready to harvest. The results show that it can detect mushrooms in the greenhouse with an F1-score of up to 76.5%. The classification in the final stage of mushroom growth gives an accuracy of up to 70%, which is acceptable considering the complexity of the photos used. In addition, we propose a method for mushroom growth monitoring based on Detectron2. Our method shows that the average growth period of the mushrooms is 5.22 days. Moreover, our method is also adequate to indicate the harvesting day. The evaluation results show that it could improve the time to harvest for 14.04% of the mushrooms.",

        "text": "Therefore, improving the production line will have a major impact on the economy of the speci\ufb01c domain. The authors in [4] presented a comprehensive review of the factors affecting the mushrooms of the genus Pleurotus spp. In addition, many research efforts have focused on solutions based on modern technologies from the Internet of things, aiming to transform traditional farming into the new era called smart farming [5]. This transition brings many applications in various agriculture tasks aiming to increase production, reduce cost production, reduce chemical inputs, and reduce labour effort. Along with other technologies, machine learning is highly used in tasks such as yield prediction, disease detection, weed recognition, and fruit recognition. More speci\ufb01cally, many research efforts try to classify and detect the speci\ufb01c location of different objects in images. For example, a robotic mechanism is suitable for weeding if it has the ability to recognise weeds from vegetation [6]. The detection of fruits with machine learning is also valuable in robotic mechanisms [7\u20139]. Disease detection has already seen numerous research efforts evaluating the ability to detect various diseases "
