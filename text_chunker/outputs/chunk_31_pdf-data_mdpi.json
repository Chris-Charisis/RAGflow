        "abstract": "Mushrooms contain valuable nutrients, proteins, minerals, and vitamins, and it is suggested to include them in our diet. Many farmers grow mushrooms in restricted environments with specific atmospheric parameters in greenhouses. In addition, recent technologies of the Internet of things intend to give solutions in the agriculture area. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of machine learning for mushroom growth monitoring for the genus Pleurotus. We use YOLOv5 to detect mushrooms' growing stage and indicate those ready to harvest. The results show that it can detect mushrooms in the greenhouse with an F1-score of up to 76.5%. The classification in the final stage of mushroom growth gives an accuracy of up to 70%, which is acceptable considering the complexity of the photos used. In addition, we propose a method for mushroom growth monitoring based on Detectron2. Our method shows that the average growth period of the mushrooms is 5.22 days. Moreover, our method is also adequate to indicate the harvesting day. The evaluation results show that it could improve the time to harvest for 14.04% of the mushrooms.",

        "text": "ns=== Object detection and instance segmentation have multiple applications in various domains. In smart farming, it is mainly used in fruit detection, weed detection, or pest detection. In this paper, we evaluated the effectiveness of YOLOv5 and Detectron2 in mushroom detection in a greenhouse. Firstly, we evaluated YOLOv5 on its effectiveness in classifying mushrooms in three growth stages. The results showed that even in complex environments such as a greenhouse with Pleurotus mushrooms, it was possible to identify mushrooms that were ready to harvest. The evaluation results on mushroom detection and classi\ufb01cation in three different growing stages gave an F1-score of up to 76.5%, and speci\ufb01cally for the \ufb01nal growing stage, an accuracy of up to 70%. Secondly, we proposed a method for mushroom growth monitoring. For that purpose, we used two trained models with Detectron2. The \ufb01rst one detected the substrate grow bag, and the second detected the mushrooms and returned the corresponding masks. Experi- mental results showed that the growth rate of Pleurotus mushrooms was linear. Moreover, this procedure made it possible to detect when mushrooms reached their maximum size and were re"
