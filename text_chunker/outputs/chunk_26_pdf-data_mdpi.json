        "abstract": "Mushrooms contain valuable nutrients, proteins, minerals, and vitamins, and it is suggested to include them in our diet. Many farmers grow mushrooms in restricted environments with specific atmospheric parameters in greenhouses. In addition, recent technologies of the Internet of things intend to give solutions in the agriculture area. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of machine learning for mushroom growth monitoring for the genus Pleurotus. We use YOLOv5 to detect mushrooms' growing stage and indicate those ready to harvest. The results show that it can detect mushrooms in the greenhouse with an F1-score of up to 76.5%. The classification in the final stage of mushroom growth gives an accuracy of up to 70%, which is acceptable considering the complexity of the photos used. In addition, we propose a method for mushroom growth monitoring based on Detectron2. Our method shows that the average growth period of the mushrooms is 5.22 days. Moreover, our method is also adequate to indicate the harvesting day. The evaluation results show that it could improve the time to harvest for 14.04% of the mushrooms.",

        "text": "(M4), from which it seemed that the mushroom was ready to harvest on day \ufb01ve. Figure 12. Mushroom growth example photos. We manually evaluated the harvesting status of each mushroom and decided that 17 mushrooms could be harvested earlier, which represented 14.04% of the mushrooms. The average difference between the size of the masks from the day identi\ufb01ed as ready to harvest and the previous day was 5.34%. Thus, if we set it as a threshold in our method to provide an alert any time that the difference in the mushroom size was below it, we could inform the farmer of the harvest time. This would lead to an improvement in the quality of the harvested mushrooms as we would avoid overripe mushrooms. In addition, our evaluation showed that the average days for the growth of mushrooms was 5.22. Figure 13 displays the graph with all mushrooms detected for all days. All values are displayed in percentage of the maximum size of the speci\ufb01c mushroom. The blue marks indicate the detected mushrooms that were not ready to harvest, while the red marks indicate mushrooms that should have been harvested at least one day before. ===discussion=== Our \ufb01rst approach for mushroom detection with YOLOv5 "
