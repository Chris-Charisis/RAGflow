We handle the collinear final-state photon singularities in the manner described in Sec. [I] without including photon fragmentation functions explicitly. An alternative calculation implemented in the DIPHOX code includes NLO cross sections for single-photon fragmentation processes. Neither code includes a term in which both photons are fragmentation products of the same final- state parton, i.e., the diphoton fragmentation function D,,(z1, 22). In Ref. 2 we"
