        "abstract": "Mushrooms contain valuable nutrients, proteins, minerals, and vitamins, and it is suggested to include them in our diet. Many farmers grow mushrooms in restricted environments with specific atmospheric parameters in greenhouses. In addition, recent technologies of the Internet of things intend to give solutions in the agriculture area. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of machine learning for mushroom growth monitoring for the genus Pleurotus. We use YOLOv5 to detect mushrooms' growing stage and indicate those ready to harvest. The results show that it can detect mushrooms in the greenhouse with an F1-score of up to 76.5%. The classification in the final stage of mushroom growth gives an accuracy of up to 70%, which is acceptable considering the complexity of the photos used. In addition, we propose a method for mushroom growth monitoring based on Detectron2. Our method shows that the average growth period of the mushrooms is 5.22 days. Moreover, our method is also adequate to indicate the harvesting day. The evaluation results show that it could improve the time to harvest for 14.04% of the mushrooms.",

For example, it may be useful in tasks such as yield prediction or product improvement by indicating those mushrooms that are ready for harvest. Overall, the accuracy of the trained model was considered acceptable regarding the complexity of the photos of the dataset. However, our experience shows that some changes could improve the results. A more precisely selected dataset should improve the detection accuracy of different classes. For example, photos with fewer mushrooms and only in the foreground will give more accurate results. As we discussed in Figure 9, the main drawback in detection accuracy is that many mushrooms are partially visible in the photos, and many of them are in the background, which makes it dif\ufb01cult to detect and classify because their features are not clear. Moreover, a proposed methodology to overcome these obstacles could be to exclude mushrooms that are partially displayed in the picture and to focus only"
